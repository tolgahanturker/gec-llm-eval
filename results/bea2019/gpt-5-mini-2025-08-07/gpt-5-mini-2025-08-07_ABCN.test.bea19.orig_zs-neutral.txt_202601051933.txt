Dear Sir ,
I saw your advertisement online and am writing to apply for a summer position as an instructor and caregiver for children at your camp .
I am working as a teacher at a Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
I am an easygoing person with a lot of empathy for children .
On the other hand , in my leisure time I usually do sports like jogging or swimming and adventurous activities like trekking , climbing , or speleology , which I have been doing for 20 years .
I have travelled to most European countries , and I am able to understand , speak , and write three languages fluently : Spanish , English , and French .
This is why I believe I could be a suitable candidate for the job .
I would like to tell you that I will be able to work in July and August .
I hope it has not caused you any inconvenience .
To that end , could you please tell me what salary you are offering for his job ?
I look forward to hearing from you .
Best regards ,
Mirta Rojo
Hi . I am so happy to write here . My favorite sport is riding a bicycle .
It is a nice sport , especially when we play it in the morning . It gives the body energy and helps regulate the heart 's work .
I do this sport for ten minutes daily because I have liked it since childhood .
My advice to anyone starting to learn this sport is to be careful to avoid accidents because it requires a lot of concentration to ride . That is all .
Thank you
I 've been studying English for several years , but I 'm not really sure exactly what my current goal is .
I 've been moving around , and I do n't know which place is best for me .
What I 'm sure about is that I 'm going to need an official certificate to prove that I 've studied the language .
I study English because I love it , and I 'd like to speak it fluently and watch movies without subtitles .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is speaking , but when I have to speak in English it 's not so easy .
I 'm very motivated , and I 'm going to continue my studies , but I need to be clear about where I 'm going .
I 'd like to teach the language to little children .
Next year , I 'm going to focus on speaking and perhaps take a formal test .
Otherwise , I 'd like to improve my grammar and writing , so I 'll keep trying hard .
Thank you for helping me .
The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic .
It is , however , in my opinion , the best basis for government .
Consider a general election in which three parties—X , Y , and Z—are standing in a country of 5,000 voters .
Suppose 2,000 people vote for Party X and 1,500 vote for Parties Y and Z . Party X would come into power because it has the most votes .
However , 3,000 people did not want them to be in power , which did not represent the majority of the country 's population .
Also , the idea that each constituency should have an MP who fights for its beliefs in Parliament .
This has major flaws .
Consider , for example , the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties .
Yes , I know MPs believe that constituents are meant to vote on their MP 's ideas , but this simply is n't the case in many circumstances ; voters often vote on how the party the MP represents is doing at the moment .
Once a party is in government , it is free to do as it likes , changing its policies until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .
It is , as I said before , the best system .
Consider dictatorships . This falls at the first hurdle .
With this system , any madman can control a country , causing economic disasters not only for that country but also for other related countries .
There is no fair and perfect way to run a country .
You can please some of the people some of the time , but you ca n't please all of the people all of the time .
The only way a fair system of government can come about is among a group of at most ten people , and even then people are discontent .
Hi Karina ,
Thanks for your letter .
Of course I can tell you about Dulan .
He is 23 and is a second-year electronic engineering student at Kelaniya University .
He has an older sister who has just finished her IT degree and is now looking for a job .
His mother teaches biology to Advanced Level students at Ananda College , Colombo 10 , and his father works at People 's Bank as an assistant manager .
He 's a cool , charming , and very sociable person .
He 's also sensitive .
When someone faces trouble , he does n't look to others ; he steps forward to help them as much as he can .
Not only is he a responsible and reliable guy .
Sometimes he borrows my personal things ( laptop , pen drives ) and returns them to me on time in the same condition .
He 's incredibly hardworking . That 's the secret behind his exam results .
He likes going out with friends , watching movies , and listening to music using his hi-fi headset , so do n't worry about noise . He 's a good rugby player and plays for his university team . He 's crazy about computer games .
He had already finished many popular computer games when we left school , but he knows his limits and knows how to manage his studies without distractions .
He 's keen on sports cars .
He has a large collection of pictures and videos of sports cars .
He also has a good knowledge of automobiles .
I know that most of the time he does some repairs himself .
So it may be helpful to you while he is on holiday .
The only negative things I can think of are that he 's a bit untidy and not well organised .
His room is usually a mess , and sometimes he looks for his belongings for hours .
His written English is very good , but he is n't a fluent speaker . I 'm sure he 'll learn it quickly .
Finally , I think he 's really nice , and you and your family will get on well with him .
I hope the above information is useful .
Let me know if you need more information about him .
Love ,
Lioyni
A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one central to the question of sovereignty , is that the Westminster Parliament is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
According to the orthodox school , which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person anywhere , including aliens outside British territory .
In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .
If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept its decision and pass judgement accordingly .
Of course , in practice , as the Radical school ( which believes that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) points out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisians would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation , and Parliament would in effect be fettered .
Dicey said that , as each Parliament is omnipotent and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content , manner , or form of subsequent legislation .
Radicals like to point out that , since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
The orthodox school retaliates by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act , thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal the Act and take the UK out of Europe again .
In this case , Britain would have retained its sovereignty and parliamentary supremacy .
Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
British courts have avoided a head-on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations ; by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament ; or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertent and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with Community law .
In a recent development , the European Court of Justice ruled in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament when the rights of citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
This case , for the first time , held that it is a principle of UK law , as influenced by the European Court , that our Parliament is not supreme in all circumstances .
It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe indeed means a loss of sovereignty for Britain , despite what the orthodox school may think .
Young people are interested in many things like games , music , television programmes and the clothes they wear .
Young people , like children , like to play games , listen to music , watch TV , and wear special clothes .
Now , in 2015 , the game that young people are interested in is speed stacking .
In music , they are interested in Taylor Swift 's songs because they are so wonderful that even I listen to them every day .
Young people do n't actually like television programmes , but they like channels that have horror films , romantic films , and films with happy endings .
This year there are fantastic clothes everywhere , especially in the UAE .
Dear Sirs ,
I am writing in response to your job advertisement for the summer camps in the USA .
I am a twenty-year-old student from Poland looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
I would like to apply for the job you are offering and intend to demonstrate that I am a suitable candidate .
In Poland , I have been a scout for ten years .
There I had various tasks ; one of them was looking after younger children .
I helped to organise Scout camps all over my country .
We organised many sporting and cultural activities .
Apart from being a Scout , I have also been a lifeguard at kitesurfing camps in Poland .
I am not afraid of working in the kitchen .
I am also able to perform the harder tasks , such as washing the dishes or tidying up .
I believe you will consider my application .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
I beg to differ ; crime does pay .
Many criminals live far better lives than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .
Being a criminal has its advantages : you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set your own hours because you 're your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .
Let 's take the time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard-working person .
In our changing economy , any individual who holds down a job must be concerned about whether or not he or she will continue to have that job .
Many people are being laid off or let go because companies are no longer making enough profit to pay their employees .
A criminal will always be employed .
There is never a lack of work as a means of maintaining employment .
Think about the workday of most working people .
The average worker works 8 hours per day .
They make about $ 7.50 per hour for their labor .
This is $ 300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions .
Tax deductions will run about $ 69.00 per week , and deductions for medical and dental insurance will cost them another $ 5.00 per week , bringing their actual take-home pay to $ 266.00 per week .
The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300 without having to be concerned about deductions for medical insurance or taxes .
Furthermore , the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time or for a specific number of hours each day .
The criminal is his or her own boss .
Finally , the one thing the criminal has in common with the average worker is retirement .
However , the criminal can retire much faster than the worker if he or she has managed to save some of the money he or she has stolen over the years .
If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 , he or she could be set for life .
At $ 300.00 per hour , the criminal earns $ 1,170,000.00 over 15 years .
If they invest half of this money and earn interest , they could potentially live on the interest income alone .
Comparing the two options here , I 'd definitely say that crime does pay .
I was born in Thailand and have been living in Samut Prakan , a small city near Bangkok .
There are many types of transportation in Thailand .
I often take a motorcycle , a minibus , and the BTS .
I rarely take the bus .
In my experience .
A motorcycle is a very convenient form of transportation .
It 's the fastest way to travel when you 're in a rush .
It is needed in a hurry .
On the other hand , it is not very safe .
Motorcycles are the most dangerous form of transport in Thailand compared with other modes .
Even though we have traffic rules , some riders still keep breaking them .
Continuing with the minibus , here are some rules for this type of transportation .
The drivers have to follow the traffic rules .
I found it to be a good , low-cost form of transportation that can travel long distances .
Therefore , low- to middle-class people prefer to use this mode of transport .
People who live around the city usually make an appointment downtown .
Because of heavy traffic in Bangkok , they try to avoid other services .
Then BTS is the best option .
It is very satisfying in terms of time and convenience .
People can manage their time more easily because BTS is fixed in time .
Therefore , this transport is the most predictable .
Thailand is a country that is not strict about rules .
Therefore , you can hear news about accidents in the country .
Customers and drivers are not disciplined .
My suggestion for the above problems is to start showing people how much priority regulations should have .
Drivers , customers , and even the police officers should cooperate .
Dear Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I am studying English ( ESOL ) in my third year of college , and I can speak English very well .
I would like to deal with people , and I can speak many languages , so I communicate well with them .
I would like to work long hours on weekends because I go to college on weekdays , and I am happy to do so .

Humanity witnessed one of the most incredible minds in recorded history at work when Albert Einstein came onto the scene .
Although the theory he and his wife proposed was basically scientific in nature , it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence .
The theory I 'm speaking of is relativity .
With this theory came the field of quantum mechanics .
It is difficult to condense this topic , which has volumes of literature .
Personally , I find that relativity has n't yet had its full impact .
This is probably for several reasons . First , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are relative to that point of departure is rather abstract .
It seems impossible , and it leaves humans grasping for closure .
What Einstein did to humanity 's philosophy was to change the notion that closure could be obtained .
The Socratic idea was that all was known .
And that it was only a matter of time before a " moment " would reveal that the knowledge from " within " was , in effect , shattered .
The philosopher 's stone was pulverized into utopian and nostalgic dust .
Since my socialization leads me to have a notion of Earth time ( 24 hours = day ) , I think Einstein reconstructed part of it .
Although I do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to immerse myself in the topic , like Siddhartha and his rock .
The point is , my notion of time has changed , and I think that once humanity realizes that notions of time are human constructions and subject to change , the impact of Einstein 's idea will be felt .
For now , we are left with a world that has used Einstein 's 'invention ' for purposes unworthy of the genius , namely atomic bombs .
The significance of atomic bombs can not be overstated when discussing humanity in the 20th century .
It set up a whole network of global systems .
USA and USSR , with Japan and Germany as the " winners . "
Cold Wars : North–South Relations .
Many things have been generated—namely , fear !
Relatively speaking , fear has been the primary impetus behind the construction of the global community .
This is a point that I think should be changed from fear to peace .
A shift in focus , if you will .
Some would say this is too utopian .
But if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as Stephen Hawking did ) , our notions would be radically changed .
For now , we must deal with the shortcomings of humanity 's use of Einstein 's ideas : atomic weapons .
Yesterday I went to a basketball club . In my first training session , I scored four baskets .
It was the first time I had played basketball .
I think I was very good .
My dream is to be a basketball player . Playing basketball is really fun and nice .
I loved playing it .
I want to play it again
It is undeniable that animals are vital to medical research because of their many benefits .
Researchers could use animals ( such as mice and monkeys ) to examine the new drugs .
Furthermore , animals were probably used to determine the dosage .
These uses certainly indicate whether the vaccine is functional .
In addition , it defines the maximum dosage beyond which the drug becomes lethal .
Also , one of the main purposes of using animals in the lab is to obtain antidotes for their bites , for instance from snakes .
Even a bite could kill a person if a suitable antidote is not available .
Writing about my favourite sport means talking about one of the best things in my life , since I 'm a sports fan and have been throughout my life .
While I was in high school , I still recall dreading the moment I had to go to gym class , but somehow later in life I discovered that sports would not only save my life .
Furthermore , it became one of my favourite pastimes .
No matter what my mood was , putting on my trainers and finding a new place to discover made the possibilities endless : parks , the beach , running tracks .
Getting lost in the middle of the woods—anytime , anyplace .
Then , one thing led to another , and starting rollerblading , cycling , skiing , or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
Little did I know then that I would meet the man of my life through sports .
To conclude , I would like to leave a message for all those young people out there who do n't seem to fit in anywhere .
Taking part in any free-time activity would help you become a better person .
You will learn to share , compete , and lead a healthier life .
Believe that your potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit .
As it says in the book " Say It Again , See It Again , " artistic research is a complicated and frequently discussed topic .
In academic fields , there is some question about how artistic research relates to research within the academic framework .
When we look it up in the dictionaries to find out what research is in academic study , we read this definition :
" The systematic investigation and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions . "
According to UNESCO 's definition , research is " any creative and systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture , and society , and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications . "
Another source said that research involves searching for and gathering information , usually to answer a particular question or solve a problem .
We look for artistic research .
It is said that artistic research is a process of making artwork .
Those two terms , academic research and artistic research , differ mainly in their results .
In the academic field , after research , we have some knowledge that can be generalized .
A conclusion of academic research becomes a law that endures over time .
In artistic research , we work with singular knowledge , which is unique .
It can not really be regarded as a law or a long-term statement . Because of the experimental , unpredictable , multidisciplinary , and creative character of artistic research , it is difficult to define what artistic research really is .
Artistic research does not produce only knowledge .
It changes people 's mindset .
Artistic research is a form of research because artists seek knowledge in order to create works of art .
So , in art , research exists in the artwork itself .
I have read in the book about artistic research that artists are doing their research without calling it research .
Mrs. Kate Ashby ,
I would like to apply for a weekend job at Green Pepper Cafe .
I am a twenty-one-year-old student .
Food is the most important part of my life . It makes me happy .
I really like to cook different kinds of dishes from all over the world for my friends .
I am used to working long hours because during the last holidays I had a full-time job at a beach bar .
I am an open-minded , smiling person who loves to meet new people and learn new things .
I think I am a calm and friendly person ; to me , a satisfied client is a happy client .
I also know Spanish , which could be helpful when talking with tourists from Spain .
I hope you would like to meet with me and learn more about my experience working in bars and cafes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
With kind regards , Clarita .
Watching " Cuéntame " might not be the first film you think of about Spain in the last century , but it is , in fact , a good example of our country 's history at that time .
Although it was shot last year by a young director , he must have known how difficult life was , so he likely studied society , customs , clothing , and hairstyles in detail , because the elders say it is a true reflection of Spanish life .
Moreover , pensioners said the movie reminded them of their youth , so it is a realistic film .
On the other hand , it is more than likely that they will be a bit sad , homesick , and may even shed a tear .
The movie reflects the life of an average family with a toddler , two teenage children , and a grandmother who always wears black because she lost her husband in the Spanish Civil War .
While the parents are working out , she does the housework and takes care of her grandchildren .
On top of that , it documents the beginning of the democratic age , how difficult the birth of some political parties was , and , of course , how women begged to be allowed to smoke , wear skinny trousers , or obtain a driving license .
It was a strange change in this country .
To sum up , I strongly recommend this movie not only for students and young people but also for middle-aged and elderly people . In addition , it would be a great movie for people from other countries , as it would help them easily understand our history .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I would like to work in the cafe at the weekend .
I have worked at cafes many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have visited Green Pepper Cafe many times and drink coffee there .
It was very good , and the people working there were happy .
I would like to work at your place because I am interested in many types of food and really enjoy meeting people .
I also work long hours in a cafe I like .
Please tell me soon if I have an interview .
Schooling of the children .
I think children must be educated at school , not at home .
At school , they learn to interact with other people and , from a young age , to handle different situations , viewpoints , and cultures .
Knowledge is not just what we learn by sitting on a chair , but also how to deal with society .
It does n't make any sense for a person to be very smart , intelligent , and knowledgeable about so many subjects if he ca n't express his ideas .
If he can act naturally when facing difficulties and stay calm when dealing with others ' thoughts that differ from his own , it demonstrates how flexible he can be in difficult situations .
Knowledge is a combination of the intellectual and emotional parts of our brains .
There must be a balance between these two parts .
Teaching the child alone at home is not a good idea for his development .
The advantage of a child learning at home is that you can see exactly what he learns , follow his study schedule , and closely observe what he is assimilating .
But , like I said before , it 's very important to help them deal with other people and situations since , when they 're little , they need to combine the rational and emotional parts of their brains .
It 's a hard decision for parents , especially for those who want to control all aspects of their children 's lives , but it 's necessary to understand how important such a decision is to their children 's future .
Is it more important to keep control of everything , or to let the child learn from their experiences and develop other skills ?
I like and really love football .
I do n't know why ; I just love it . My favourite club is Real Madrid , and my favourite football players are Kaká and CR7 .
I do n't care ; I 'll watch my favourite club 's match every time .
Through football , I can see him .
He 's my favourite player , more so than Kaka .
If I can watch his competition , I 'll watch it .
He 's my spirit , too .
I have loved football since I was in the first grade of junior high school . Usually , I watched football matches with my father .
At midnight we 're watching together ...
My lovely team is my Country Garuda Team . You 're the best in the world .
I hope the Indonesian national football team can become a great team and the best one .
This idea is completely erroneous .
Money , perhaps , is a necessary evil for conducting the daily affairs of life .
Money , in some form or other , is required to carry out trade , commerce , and the exchange of property .
Money enables a person to store what they own , to pay their expenses , to share with others , or even to give to those in need .
However , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil .
This is a different concept altogether .
The desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in ways they otherwise might not .
Although there is a healthy desire to meet our needs , at times this desire can be taken to an extreme .
How many times have we seen on the evening news a family broken apart , a company go under , or even a nation crumble , simply because there has been a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeds what is actually needed or required ?
Even individuals who are constantly searching for what eludes them can be destroyed .
They think that having the " right " car or living in the " right " neighborhood or knowing the " right " people can bring them happiness or contentment .
This love of money urges them on , causes them to neglect their families , and at times leads them to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .
Our society pays dearly , both financially and socially , for its love affair with money .
It is a cross-cultural thing .
We may be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen , or the Spanish peseta .
The love of money , which represents the financial exchange between parties , wreaks havoc on a nation , a family , and even an individual 's life .
Not the money itself , but rather the love of it , persuades men 's hearts , captivates their minds , and influences their priorities and behavior .
The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security , when pushed to an extreme , is the root of all evil .
It produces selfishness even in the smallest child .
It 's not long before a 4- or 5-year-old realizes the power that money brings .
He begins to hide it , save it , ask for it , and spend it .
A healthy thing can be turned into a tool of disaster . Is money the root of all evil ?
No .
It can be used for good .
It can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has its needs met .
However , the love of it—the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and , at times , even to commit terrible acts toward each other—is truly the root of all evil .
History is the identity of a people . It can tell future generations about the past .
As all nations and peoples have their own histories , you can not distinguish them only by the marks they left .
Historical places and archives are the most common things that show ancient life .
Every nation has its identity .
In my country , there are many historical sites that belong to different civilizations .
But the place that attracts the most people is the capital ; we can call it the crossroads of civilization .
Different civilizations settled there , from Byzantine to French , including Ottoman and others .
Our attractive historical place in the Casbah .
The Casbah is a historic city with an important story about its construction .
I believe I would be a good member of the summer camp staff .
Besides , I raised two children ; most children are very fond of me .
I always enjoy sports , especially basketball , tennis , and dance .
I 'm also good at cooking and reading books .
I hope you will select me for the job .
Dear Isabel ,
My new town is so wonderful .
I really enjoy living here !
My town is near a lake and between two larger towns .
The main attractions are a historic museum and a very big indoor bath .
My favourite place in town is a bank at the lake .
I love to sit there and watch the sunrise .
Best wishes from my lovely new home .
I live in a tiny village called Fals ; there are n't many people—only about one hundred .
In my little village , most people are farmers , and they do n't use many cars or motorbikes ; they mostly use trucks and other vehicles .
I think that in my village we take care of the environment because we do n't produce much pollution , so I can say that I live in a healthy village with low pollution .
But in my country we usually do n't take care of the environment because people in Spain do n't think of others ; they just think about themselves .
Most Spanish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not the present but the future .
Nowadays , childhood is closely tied to technology .
Most of children 's fun comes from video games , television , computers , and tablets , which they use to play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
In this way , it is clear that television entertains and is part of our lives , but it can also educate if it covers appropriate subjects .
For example , some cartoons and their characters can teach children to count in other languages , solve simple mathematical problems such as addition , and , most importantly , help them learn how to interact with their parents and friends and distinguish right from wrong ; in other words , television can influence their behavior .
On the other hand , there are many advertisements on television that can influence a child 's choices and desires ; for example , he may soon begin asking for a toy simply because of the advertising .
Therefore , it is very important that parents know what their children are watching and learning on TV .
Thus , television could be good for education , but time in front of the screen has to be controlled ; after all , childhood is also shaped by play and time outdoors .
Apparently , this is due to the huge improvements in the automobile industry , which have created a better transport environment through dramatic advances in transportation .
You can easily travel from place A to place B by stepping into a private car , which will create an electronic delivery lane and compress the car 's and driver 's data .
Drivers simply start the car , enter the correct address as the destination , view the street in three dimensions , and then drive .
You 'll arrive in only five minutes .
With the new way of driving , people do not have to walk 500 meters to public transportation , such as train or bus stations , because they buy modern cars that provide a better transport experience .
Dear Ms. Kennedy ,
Thank you for the opportunity .
It will be my great pleasure to attend the interview at 2:30 p.m .
If at all possible , I would like to have a parking space near the office .
Would you mind providing me with documentation details regarding the interview and how long it will last , please ?
Yours sincerely ,
Shundori Aranda

Dear Sir ,
I 'm really interested in your property ; it is very similar to what I 'm looking for .
I 'm Matias from Spain . I 'm currently on holiday in Dublin , but I would like to live in Dundalk because I want to improve my English and Dublin is too expensive .
I do n't smoke , but I accept it if someone does .
About the term 'rental , ' are the rooms available for six months ?
I would like to stay from September to May , more or less , but I do n't mind .
One last question : Are there any academies where I can learn English near my house ?
Thanks very much .
Please do n't hesitate to contact me if you need more information .
Kind regards .
Matias Fabio Freire
There is no doubt that all of us dream of living in a healthy environment , which requires significant efforts from both the people and the government .
But in fact this does not happen 100 % of the time , as most people are not committed to it ; many of them always throw rubbish into the streets instead of putting it in the proper place .
In the village , the farmers always throw animal carcasses and waste into the canals , dirtying the water they use to irrigate the farmlands and leading to contamination of the food .
As a matter of fact , there are an enormous number of ways to transmit information , which has always been extremely important to people , especially nowadays .
We can receive it from old-fashioned or traditional sources of information , such as books , as well as from contemporary media , for example , television and radio .
Because all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , we will consider some arguments to find the most effective .
Broadcasts are a great way to get the latest news about world events or up-to-date information in various scientific fields , whereas books can contain obsolete or inadequate information .
Indeed , scientists have shown that about half of the information in books becomes outdated within 5 to 10 years .
In contrast , we find that some information on television and on the radio is deliberately distorted .
Nowadays , it is commonly held that the media are the fourth estate and can influence our consciousness .
It is hard to disagree when information becomes a means of warfare rather than a method of enlightenment .
Then books come to the fore as a means of understanding history : all human experience , accumulated throughout the entire span of human existence , is represented in them .
In conclusion , I believe we should not choose only one way to communicate information , as all types of media have pros and cons .
Choosing the appropriate option for receiving certain data is a skill we should learn .
Every year , there 's a winter festival in my city .
This year , there were more activities than last year .
I had a great time with my friends .
There were a lot of activities , like snowboarding , competitions , and concerts .
There was a lovely activity for the kids called " Do You Wan na Build a Snowman ? " where they had an incredible time building snowmen .
I participated in a dance competition .
The judges said I was an amazing dancer , and it was a very emotional moment for me .
I ca n't wait for the festival next year .
Football is my favorite game because it is quite challenging and interesting . I began playing football when I was six years old .
Since then , it has become my passion .
It is also called the " king of sports " and is the most famous sport in the entire world .
Hi ,
I 'm Ottavia , and I 'm 23 years old .
I was born in Gubbio , a small city in central Italy , but now I live in Turin because I 'm studying here .
I saw this advertisement and thought it was the right job for me .
I 'm energetic , always smiling , and I really enjoy meeting new people .
I love travelling because I think it is the best way to get to know new cultures and open your mind .
I 'm a very creative person ; I love organising activities , games and events .
When I was 15 , I looked after children at a summer camp organised by the church in my city in Italy .
I have no experience in this kind of job yet .
Definitely , I have done a lot of jobs to pay for my studies .
I worked in a bar , a pub , a shop , and in PR at Italian discos .
I also did PR in Ibiza .
I know very well the meaning of sacrifice and the value of hard work .
So I 'm ready to work hard , have fun , meet a lot of people , and have a beautiful , unforgettable experience !
I hope for a positive result .
Bye .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the volunteer position at the USA summer camps you advertised in Summer Holidays Magazine .
I am 23 years old , and I have just finished my studies in teaching at the University of Seville .
After the summer , I would like to work at a prestigious centre in Birmingham , The Good Shepherd School , so gaining experience at a summer camp in the United States would be a great opportunity for me .
As you can see from my attached curriculum vitae , I have been working as a nanny for two years , and I have also looked after my five little cousins on many occasions .
In addition , last summer I worked at summer camps , where I was in charge of planning and leading games and craft activities .
Being a leader made me develop a strong sense of responsibility .
In addition , I will be taking the CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) in a few weeks .
I love learning English ; in fact , I have some English exchange partners whom I talk to twice a week .
I believe a good teacher is someone who can entertain children , play with them , and teach them how to improve their skills .
I think I have all these abilities , and I am perfectly capable of doing this job .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully
Louisa Aláez
There are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef .
For example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian , or tastes may change so that no one in the UK wants to eat beef .
However , these occurrences are at best unlikely .
The only plausible reason for people in the UK to stop eating beef is Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease ( CJD ) .
This disease is the human equivalent of mad cow disease ( BSE ) .
In recent years , there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .
This seems to have been mainly caused by farming methods used 20 years ago .
In the 1960s and 1970s , cows were given feed that included sheep and their brains .
Many animals that ate this feed developed BSE , and even more passed the disease on to their young .
Many people in the UK believe that BSE can be transmitted to humans who eat beef .
There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case .
However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media , and this has greatly influenced people .
Pictures on television of cows with BSE unable to walk properly and of humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating CJD is .
If media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same way , it is conceivable that people in the UK could be so frightened that they stop eating beef entirely .
If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devastating .
The number of cow farmers would fall by a huge amount .
This is because , with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers is the dairy products market , which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products , and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
However , when people stop eating beef , what do they eat instead ?
The answer is pork , lamb , and other meats .
The increase in demand for other meats would be approximately proportional to the fall in demand for beef .
This would mean that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .
Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market , they could switch to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nil .
This is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond to a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets .
This would mean that the structure of the agricultural industry had altered greatly , with the proportion taken up by meats other than beef growing .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement , which I saw in the magazine two weeks ago .
I would be very interested in this vacancy .
I am the president of the Young Pioneers Club at my primary school , so I usually organize picnics , camping trips , sports , and other outdoor activities for students .
In order to ensure their safety , my school sometimes asks me to attend first-aid courses , which give me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
In particular , I am free from June to September .
I am a native speaker of Vietnamese , and I was awarded a B grade in the First Certificate in English last year .
I consider myself to be energetic , humorous , enthusiastic and sociable .
I will do my best to make this job a success , and I hope you will consider my application favorably . I have enclosed my CV for your consideration and would be glad to attend an interview at a time convenient to you .
Yours faithfully ,

Dear David ,
I 'm Paloma , your new pen pal friend ! I come from an island called Cozumel . I like sports and hanging out with my friends .
What did you do on vacation ?
I went to Cancún , visited museums , and went to Xpu-Há , a really beautiful beach . We stayed in an apartment near it .
There I saw a lot of tourists who were almost crying because they had eaten chili . My friends and I laughed a lot . Do not underestimate the power of chili .
Do you have brothers or sisters ? I have two little ones : one is 11 years old and the other is 7 .
I have seven pets : one parrot , two dogs , two hamsters , and two turtles . I think it 's a little more than normal .
I look forward to receiving your letter .
A hug .
Paloma
I live in a flat in the center of Magenta , near the church .
In my house there are two bedrooms , a kitchen , a studio , a bathroom , and a living room where I can play video games and watch TV .
My bedroom is amazing . I have a library of 12 shelves with many books and a big white desk where I study and do my homework .
On the walls , there are a lot of posters about cars , bikes , football , views , animals , and buildings .
The studio is n't big , but it 's very comfortable and has a PC .
The kitchen has a fridge , a freezer , and an oven , and it is connected to a little terrace with a small garden .
In the living room , there are two sofas , a table with seats , and a beautiful television .
I think my house is fantastic ; it is in a nice area , and I would never buy a motor home to live in .
My house is in a condominium complex with three other buildings , and there are 18 families in the complex .

London .
11th May 2014

Interestingly enough , this topic is one that is very important to me .
I often dwell on the aspects of human nature that lead us to continually invent new things .
We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology and with using it to dominate nature as well as our fellow humans .
Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities .
We attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fear of death , and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without petty insecurities .
For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people 's lives for the better are those that have occurred in the medical field .
Although these inventions stem from a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature or other human beings , as most other inventions do .
They save lives .
By closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions , one notices a consistent trend away from a lifestyle of peaceful coexistence with nature .
We ourselves are part of nature , yet we attempt to live outside it .
We continue to destroy plants , animals , and the Earth itself , and our new inventions help us do so more efficiently .
Therefore , inventions in the 20th century have , for the most part , had a negative effect on our lives because by destroying nature we are destroying ourselves .
In addition , our inventions are used to dominate others .
We invent better weapons and economic systems designed to kill and deprive others .
Medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
They are one of the only truly " kind " expressions of mankind 's creativity .
In modern society , especially in developed countries , traffic and its related problems affect the socioeconomic conditions of the population as a whole .
Many governments argue that these problems could be solved by increasing the cost of petrol .
To my mind , this is not the right way to solve them ; other measures need to be taken .
In many overcrowded cities , such as New York and Tokyo , the primary cause of air pollution is the chaotic , uncontrolled flow of vehicles that use fossil fuels .
This trend will certainly increase in the future due to the large number of people moving from the countryside to the city .
This phenomenon occurs especially in developing countries such as China .
However , an increase in the price of fuel is not effective in reducing traffic flow .
Indeed , over the last fifty years , this price has increased dramatically , but air pollution has continued to rise .
In some exemplary towns , such as Oslo , Norway , encouraging people to use bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
Such encouragement can be achieved through tax reductions or other financial incentives for those who ride their bikes instead of driving a car .
Another way to reduce traffic is to enhance the public transport system , for example by running larger trains and adding more bus lines .
In fact , many people prefer to travel by car , either because trains are often overcrowded or because they have to wake up early to catch the bus .
In conclusion , although increasing the price of petrol could be effective in the short term , this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and therefore can not solve the traffic-related problem .
However , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits of reduced car use .
Good morning ,
Last week I travelled with your airline . The trip was good , but I lost my luggage .
It is big and fluorescent pink with blue lines .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation ; they told me to send an email to the company .
So I 'm writing to receive my luggage .
I hope you can find it , because it contains things that are very important to me .
Write to me soon !
Noemi
I 'm very pleased that you have taken it into account .
I 'm an Italian girl , I 'm nineteen years old , and I live with my parents and my twins in the south of Italy .
When I was a baby , I used to go to summer camps with my family . I grew up at a camp .
I think I can be a suitable person for this job because I currently look after my five-year-old brothers and love cooking and playing with them ; I grew up in the South , where there are many summer camps , and I usually work at those camps in the summer , so I have experience .
I hope I have satisfied your requests . I 'm waiting for your answer .
The people living in my town are not very environmentally friendly .
They are not that way-minded .
For example , when it is time to take the rubbish out , the town hall sets a designated time for this task .
Instead , the citizens choose not to do it during this time but at any other time they like .
I do n't think this is a very proper thing to do .
My teacher asked me what I do in my free time .
I always enjoy playing video games , and I usually do so at night .
I do it at night because I study in the afternoon . I enjoy doing it .
I hang out regularly with my friends , and we have a lot of fun .
I think I am a privileged teenager .
In the past , people used public transport ; now they still do , but at a lower rate .
In my opinion , very few people will use it in the future , and maybe no one .
To start with , everyone will prefer using cars to public transport .
This is because when people use public transport , standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd tires them .
Also , having their own car will allow them to easily go to any place they want without having to wait for public transport .
Furthermore , biking and walking will replace public transportation .
This is because people are now taking care of themselves and their health .
So , they prefer bikes to cars or public transportation for their health and to save the environment from pollution .
Moreover , public transportation may be banned in the future to avoid the real harm caused by its toxic fumes .
Besides , it harms the environment and can cause acid rain and global warming .
To conclude , public transport is no longer useful .
I believe they will end because their harms far outweigh their benefits .
Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades .
Ever since the Wild West , the Civil War , and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence .
People under the age of twenty-one are considered minors when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States .
At eighteen , you are considered a man ; therefore , you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
Eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States .
In the United States , you can be conscripted to go to war at the age of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like other adults over the age of twenty-one .
Kids are dying for our country in wars , but the government will still not allow them to drink .
How can you think you are a man and fight in combat when the government says that you are too young to do what all of the other adults do ?
I think that if you can hold a gun and fight for your country , you should be able to feel the effects of drinking alcohol .
Kids are getting into too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents .
Most eighteen- to twenty-year-olds are out of high school , and their parents do not care what they do .
A high school diploma should state that the holder is old enough to make mature decisions .
You can say that some kids who are eighteen or older do not have a diploma .
You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty-one , you are not allowed to drink .
Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they have a diploma they will be able to do anything adults can do .
There would be less crime among teenagers in the United States if eighteen-year-olds were allowed to drink .
Most crimes committed by teenagers involve drinking and driving .
They are left with the choice to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents .
They can not drink in their own home , so they have to do it somewhere where their parents wo n't find out .
Eighteen-year-olds would not be put in jail for possessing alcohol in the car either , which is another crime with a high incidence among teenagers .
Drinking should be prohibited for kids eighteen or older .
If the government passes a law allowing them to drink , it will make the U.S. a better place to live .
If anything , the military should convince the government to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink .
If they pass that law , I will feel more like an adult and accept more responsibility because I am one .
The invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many people .
Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly and efficiently , and overseas travel has been drastically affected .
Without the airplane , my trip from the U.S. to Spain would have taken an extraordinary amount of time , maybe a week .
The invention of the airplane has affected areas beyond vacation travel ; business , entertainment , and intercontinental relations have also felt its impact .
As I 've already said , travel has been greatly improved by the airplane .
Travel times have been significantly shortened ; for example , driving from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours , but flying the same distance takes about 3 hours .
This gives people a greater variety of places to travel to , and they can spend their vacation time at their chosen destination instead of trying to get there .
The business world has definitely flourished because of air travel .
As a result of greatly decreased travel times , countries can work together much more easily than previously possible .
Also , business relations within a country have improved .
Today it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to establish business relations anywhere in the world .
I have seen this in the growth of international business over the past few decades .
Entertainment , a very large field , has grown since the invention of the airplane .
Now , entertainers , whether they are musicians , actors , or athletes , can travel from place to place much more quickly .
For example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid ; this was made much easier by air travel .
Professional athletic teams have reduced travel times and can play more games in many different places because travel is so easy .
The last area I 'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations .
This area has been affected both positively and negatively .
Positive aspects are those such as " peace talks " between nations ; these would not take place as often as they do if it took the President a week to get to where they were going .
Also , heads of state can more easily interact with each other in their respective countries using air transportation .
There are negative aspects , too .
Unfortunately , airplanes have been used in wars .
Japan 's bombing of Pearl Harbor , for example , and the U.S. 's dropping of atomic bombs on Japan .
The invention of the airplane has had many positive effects ; unfortunately , it has also brought about some negative changes .
Nowadays the number of cars is increasing and the use of public transport is decreasing .
There are many pros and cons to using cars .
First of all , it is very useful .
You can drive anywhere at any time . Secondly , it is more economical .
There is an opinion that in any job , discipline should prevail over talent .
To my mind , I would not even question the statement .
Firstly , only regular , consistent self-development ( which requires great discipline ) can turn a talent into a perfected skill across different professions .
Talent is nothing without discipline .
It is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without hard work .
Even ballet dancers are famous for their strict discipline .
Secondly , even if a person lacks any obvious innate abilities , they can , with discipline , develop excellent skills and become more impressive than undisciplined talent .
To add to this , the last World Hockey Championship showed how weak our Russian team , filled with brilliant players , was against the less talented but more disciplined American team .
However , not all people share my thoughts .
They say that if you are genuinely talented , discipline is unimportant because your talent is enough .
They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions , and that if you are not gifted , no amount of discipline will help you .
I am afraid I can not agree with these people ; I think discipline is more important than talent because talent alone is never enough and needs support and day-to-day development .
In creative professions , Pierre Cardin says that discipline and patience come first for him .
I guess we can trust him .
To sum up , the problem is twofold and complicated , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
Well , my first impression is that I completely disagree with the statement because I believe public transportation is much more convenient than cars and is one of the best travel options apart from walking or cycling .
The reason is simple .
Travel consumes energy , so if you must expend energy , it is more economical and environmentally friendly to transport many people with the same amount of energy .
You can also use cleaner energy sources more effectively with public transport than with private cars ( for example , electricity from solar or wind ) , which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a significant percentage .
On the other hand , you may experience less comfort or poorer availability for any trip you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport are more significant than the disadvantages .
There were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed .
The main issue raised was unemployment in the pool company industry .
Because the Lottery would seem more appealing—offering larger winnings , attracting greater public interest , and being easier to fill in than a pools coupon—fewer people would use pools coupons , and this drop in demand could force pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon to make employees redundant because of reduced profits .
There were also concerns about addiction and about people under sixteen obtaining numbers .
When the National Lottery was introduced , along with scratch cards , many people became addicted to buying them ; most were unemployed or poorly paid , and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future wealth , but for many this hope proved unfounded , and addiction resulted in large debts or in violence and theft to obtain extra money ; it was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick .
It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery tickets , encouraging the whole nation , especially its youth , to become compulsive gamblers , when the money could be better spent , for instance , on extra food for the family or on saving for a holiday or a car .
There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackpot would be each week and to the idea of rollovers increasing this figure even more .
Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multimillionaires , and that the untold pressure of fame—appearing on the front pages of tabloids and receiving begging letters—would make them crack , causing them to lose many friends and never lead a normal life again .
In the end , it was thought that the lottery would lead to less money being put into charity collection boxes , since everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery card rather than in a collection box .
Despite this , after a year of the National Lottery 's operation , many cases have been put forward for retaining it .
The main point is the amount of money that goes towards research charities ; this was not the case at the start but was introduced later . Grants are also given to preserve our country 's heritage and culture , for example by funding extensive work to repair an existing art gallery .
Also , many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for young people and the public to express themselves , to get them off the streets , and to discipline them .
Another case for retaining it is that people are still prepared to buy tickets ; if there is demand , there is no reason why supply should not also be available .
It gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week .
It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout the country , as they receive a small percentage of the proceeds from each ticket sold .
There was an explosion of inventions during the twentieth century , ranging from the garbage disposal to the A-bomb .
Some were created to make our lives easier , others to make our lives longer , and all were created for the purpose of advancing civilization .
While each of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another , some stand out as having changed our way of life more significantly .
Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competitors ; that is , the television .
Before the late 1940s , entertainment , news , and information virtually all came through newspapers and radio .
Under a system that seemed to work , many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio or a newspaper where they could get the day 's information easily and completely .
And in the case of the radio , everything happened almost immediately .
With descriptions of sporting events , voices acting out stories , and government officials speaking directly to the people , the radio seemed the perfect solution for countries with citizens living throughout their territories .
The advent of television , however , changed all of that , giving the public a peek at what radio was n't able to give them .
Along with the news and information the radio brought into the homes of people around the world , television added images—pictures that enhanced the audience 's absorption of what was being broadcast .
Where once a reporter 's voice described a scene , people could now see for themselves what was happening , since it was unfolding before their eyes .
Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment that watching television may bring its viewers , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring different worlds together .
The president of one country can be seen and heard in a distant country , giving his views and ideas so that everyone can understand him .
The small-town store owner can watch her son in his Olympic race as it 's happening , without spending thousands to travel to see him in person .
The examples could be endless .
However , the strength of television must be recognized , as it does have the power to reach many and to persuade many more .
It is a multimillion-dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media , which have become a significant part of our lives .
It is a power we should be thankful to have , as long as we do just that—control it .
We can make television work for us in medicine , politics , education , and so much more , so it is necessary to remember to keep our vision for television .
In Brazil , where I have lived since I was born , we have a culture of playing soccer .
In my country , almost everyone prefers soccer .
Today , my country is hosting the FIFA World Cup .
This is the second time Brazil has hosted the World Cup .
The last time was in 1950 , when Brazil lost the final to Uruguay at a packed Maracanã .
Millions of people expect Brazil to win the World Cup .
Environmental Problems
What will the future be like in 30 years ' time ?
We think that the planet will be in very bad condition , that trees will disappear in 20 or 30 years because of deforestation , and that humans will have more wars because water will disappear .
After that , the poles will melt completely because the Sun 's temperature will become extremely high and harsh , so some people will die of diseases , for example cancer .
The air pollution will be extreme because cars will be flying above the streets and technology will have completely changed .
Also , in 20 years we 'll be eating more fast food , and our anatomy will have changed .
So , before all this becomes serious , we must begin to take care of our beautiful world .
For sure , travelling by car is more convenient , but I do n't agree with the claim that public transport has no future for many reasons : first of all , cost-wise it can be more efficient ; secondly , the population requires greater unity than before to reduce environmental damage and save our planet ; and to increase opportunities for building good relationships among people using public transportation , we need to improve the vehicles and the bus and train stations that provide these services .
Dear TOEFL Staff , I am writing about your email concerning my TOEFL iBT test .
I decided to take the TOEFL iBT to apply to the University of Copenhagen , and I indicated the U.K. only as an option , but it is not my first choice .
Can I take the test anyway , or do I have to cancel my reservation ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Abortion is a controversial topic in today 's society .
Almost everyone has an opinion on the subject .
Many people believe it should be illegal .
Many others believe that the government should not interfere ; it should remain the individual 's choice .
Perhaps poverty , personal choice , and illegal abortions are examples of why people should maintain their right to decide .
Abortion is a right of the people , and it should remain so .
One in four women will experience rape or attempted rape in her lifetime .
Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you , and then being forced to give birth to that child .
Would you be able to love him or her ?
Recovering from this traumatic event takes months or years .
Without the right to an abortion , many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling than they would otherwise receive .
Most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty-stricken areas of society .
Generally , children born into impoverished environments remain at that socioeconomic level for their entire lives .
Lower-income families also tend to have five children on average , while middle- and upper-income families tend to have only two children .
By offering abortion to low-income people , you are helping to maintain a balance between the number of low-income families and middle- and upper-income families .
Women deserve the right to have an abortion . They won this right in the case of Roe v. Wade .
This was a landmark victory for pro-choice women across America .
Without this case , women would probably not be able to make the choice today .
No one should be able to decide whether another person should be allowed to have an abortion .
This includes religious people and the government itself , because if they remove this right , who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually ?
If abortion were to be outlawed again , would this end the practice ?
Many women would continue to seek abortions , whether at some unsanitary underground " clinic " or on their own with a primitive tool like a coat hanger or a similar device .
Abortion would still be rampant , but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and be more expensive .
Without abortions , where would all the unwanted children go ?
The basic plan would be to place them in adoptive homes , but this would cost taxpayers huge sums of money .
The average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars for eighteen years .
Infant mortality rates would skyrocket because there would be a higher proportion of ignorant and uncaring parents .
The education systems in Iraq and Australia
There is a big difference between Iraq and Australia in their education systems , and this stems from differences in learning styles , as shown below :
In Iraq , people still prefer old learning styles : schools provide basic knowledge based on the curriculum and at the same time focus on homework , while in Australia they emphasize indirect education through songs , painting , and stories and do not care much about homework because students complete their work at school .
I think parents in Iraq care more about their children 's academic results than parents in Australia do because the level of education in Iraq determines their children 's destiny , and Iraqi people prefer formal jobs over informal or freelance work .
Both Iraqis and Australians believe that knowledge is gained through education , and it is not .
Hello , my name is Lucio and I am from Mexico City .
Nowadays the environment is suffering around the world , especially in my city , which is one of the largest in the world , so four years ago I decided to do something to help save natural resources .
The first thing I do every day is place a bucket behind me to collect wasted water , which I then use to wash the yard .
The second thing I do is use energy-saving bulbs throughout my house ; this action reduces the pollution caused by my home , and the last thing I do is turn off the faucet while I brush my teeth .
I can do more for the environment , but at the moment I 'm comfortable with the actions I take every day .
Travelling by motorway today is not as easy as it was meant to be by any standards , yet every morning and evening the motorways across the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
Not only is this ecologically unsound , due to the harmful byproducts of the combustion engine , as has recently been stressed in the press , but it is also stressful , time-wasting , and expensive .
Earth has a finite supply of fossil fuels , from which petroleum and diesel for our cars and trains are derived , but we may need to get to work anywhere up to 200 miles away .
Not only are there problems in traveling from A to B , but the likelihood is that , if B is any major city , you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park .
In pre-war Britain , rail was the only means of long-distance travel within the UK , so the rail system was more efficient , with more frequent trains and many more stations ; as the motor car became more popular , fewer people used the railways , and the reduced demand led to less frequent services and higher prices .
In my opinion , the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused by the average two-car family .
The majority of the cars that you will see whilst travelling at a snail 's pace along the M6 outside Birmingham are driven by a single person with no passengers . If these drivers offered to give a colleague from work a lift home , the number of cars on the road would effectively be halved .
Cities such as Manchester have tried hard to control the increasing number of cars by introducing bypasses and providing multi-storey car parking .
Some cities have even banned cars from entering the city during work hours , making life for pedestrians more enjoyable .
Trams have been reintroduced in some cities , allowing people to leave their cars at home to do their shopping .
This , in my opinion , is the attitude that should be adopted not only by town and city councils but also by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
It was like her first day at school .
She stood before the great building and began searching for a clue that could help her overcome the feelings of uncertainty , desperation , and terrible curiosity that invaded her .
What was required of her ?
How was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings who looked so much like humans but were not in the least similar to anyone she had ever known ?
They were not animals , they were not machines , they were not automatons , but they were ready to use her and then give her back empty , with neither a soul nor a mind .
She was there to negotiate the end of the war .
She was alone , and there were millions of them .
They had crept unnoticed .
An entire civilization , soon to be lost , was fighting to survive , and its future was in her hands .
They owed her everything , and therefore they had agreed to receive her , but would they listen to her words ?
She knew she would just tell lies—lots of lies , millions of lies—just as there were millions of beings who had reason to fight back : surveillance .
As she climbed the ruined stairs through debris and filth , some pieces of corpses remained nearby , and the smell was so disgusting she thought she would puke at any moment .
Her watch showed 13:13 ; that was a good hour , as good as any other .
The sun was obscured by dark rose-colored dust .
In today 's society , it is unrealistic to expect to work for a single company or employer for one 's entire life .
This essay explains the statement from three perspectives : economic , sociological , and legal .
Workers do not maximize financial benefits if they stay with a single company for a very long time . To attract more skilled employees , companies tend to pay higher salaries to people who move from another company .
In Japan , for example , many workers look for new jobs after spending several years at a company in order to get a better position at another company .
Except for those whose primary motivation for working is not money , one should consider working for several companies to improve one 's life .
A person who stays at a single company for their entire life will be constantly exposed to degrading opinions because some societies regard people who do not change companies as less competent .
Again , in Japan , because of a social norm that competent workers frequently change jobs to obtain better positions , some people see those who stay at a single company as incompetent and less ambitious .
Because we are very sensitive to how others see us , we are less likely , given today 's social standards , to work for a single company for a very long time .
Companies benefit more if they hire new employees for a short period .
Some countries require a company to hire an individual as a regular worker if they have worked for a specified number of years .
In Japan , for example , with the intention of securing jobs for young people , companies are required to hire part-time workers as regular full-time employees after they have worked for more than four years .
This has burdened some companies that hire only part-time workers to reduce personnel costs ; as a result , many do not renew work contracts beyond four years .
Again , it is unrealistic for a worker to spend their entire career at a single company .
Everything happened three years ago .
His father was very angry with Michael because Michael was n't the person he used to be .
Michael came back very late one night .
He was going out with people who were a bad influence on him .
They were drinking every night and they were out of control .
That day Michael 's father talked with him and gave him one last opportunity to change .
At first , Michael was out of control .
He started yelling at his father and hitting the furniture , so he was unable to hear what his father was saying .
Michael decided to leave because he did n't want to cause any more problems , but it was too late .
If his father had understood why Michael was acting this way , Michael 's father would have punished him severely .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Hi Isabel !
Where are you now ?
What are you doing at the moment ?
I 'm in Oxford , United Kingdom , with my best friend , and we are visiting the city .
This is my new city now , and I love it .
Oxford is a fantastic and old city in the UK .
There are many shops of every type .
My favorite shop is Topshop ; it 's a clothing store , and I like everything .
There are many interesting universities here .
The food is n't good . I miss Italian food .
With lovely ale .
Dear Phillip ,
I 've received your letter and will respond to you as soon as I can .
You seem to be very upset about these two interests .
I think you should n't give up anything you love .
They may exhaust you and give you no time to take a break .
I went through the same thing in high school , so I can totally understand what you 're thinking .
I would rather give you some advice on how to make the most of your time .
It 's better to schedule your daily activities , which can reduce time wasted on things like surfing the Internet or watching TV . If you are still tired , try to rest .
It 's fine to take a time-out , but not to give up .
I 'm pretty sure it will work if you 're willing to give it a try .
Cheer up ! I will always be on your side .
Zumba is a healthy and fun sport .
If you want to keep fit , you must do Zumba .
Actually , Zumba is one of the sports that you can find in every gym .
It is a sport in which people move their whole bodies as they dance to different kinds of music .
Usually , one session of Zumba lasts around 60 minutes , during which you can burn approximately 600 calories .
Also , you exercise , and at the same time you feel fine .
Moreover , practising Zumba is an opportunity to meet other people and make new friends .
It is a sport that people of all ages and genders can practice—children , women , and men—and it makes them happy because they learn many challenging dances , see changes in their bodies , become healthier , and consequently improve their self-esteem .
If you do Zumba three times a week and follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight and feel better .
Furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session you should warm up your muscles to avoid injury . Begin carefully , because some songs are very fast and you could get hurt .
Also , you will need a lot of water to drink .
On the other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest and listen to some songs .
It 's better to rest during a song than to try to dance every song and end up injured .
In addition , after each session you can stretch your body thoroughly so you wo n't feel horribly stiff the next day .
You have to practice Zumba because it is a lot of fun . You 'll be the king or queen of the disco .
My city does n't have good public transportation .
We have only a bus , and the system is not good .
They are late , and there are very many people .
The government should invest more money in the system to improve it .
If politicians use the money more wisely , the situation will be much better .
Unfortunately , I can not say that my city is truly protective of nature .
The city is quite clean , but all the garbage is taken to scrapyards and stored there .
Some of it was burned , but most of the garbage will remain forever .
Well , maybe not forever , but garbage remains on collectors indefinitely .
Several years ago , special garbage containers appeared in my city .
These containers have several sections for different types of garbage .
But when a container became full , the dustcart operator poured all the garbage into the same truck .
So naturally , people were not happy to see that , and in less than a month all those containers were abandoned .
The next major environmental problem is industrial waste .
There is a river in our city that is heavily contaminated by industrial pollution .
Today all factories have filtering systems , but swimming in our river is still forbidden .
Nevertheless , I 'd like to say that our city is changing .
These changes are not happening quickly , but they are in progress .
I hope that in a couple of years I 'll be able to say that the city is really clean .
People have always seen themselves as social animals , with living together the norm .
Family life is one way we understand ourselves and our relationships , and it also shapes the way we build our places to live .
In this essay , I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of multiple generations of the same family living together in one house .
In my opinion , there are more advantages , but the worst thing that can happen is a generation gap , which is one of the reasons why relationships between teenagers and their parents or grandparents can sometimes be difficult .
On the other hand , there is nothing better than getting on well together , especially with people you can rely on and trust .
They are your family , the people you are sharing your time and space with , so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
All you need are good communication skills and empathy .
You can help each other when necessary , ask for advice , and take part in reasoned discussions .
There are some ways to prevent problems and avoid upsetting each other .
It is important to keep an open mind .
When we act like that , we will find that all of us not only survive but thrive .
Finally , family life should be nurtured and supported by all family members because unity is our strength .
Good deed .
It was a nice Saturday night in Madrid .
I was at the Plenilunio with my friends , like any 15-year-old .
When we were leaving the shopping center , I unexpectedly found a very strange handbag and was shocked by the situation .
Finding a bag with jewelry is not a mundane situation .
When I took the bag to see if there was any document or anything that could help me find the owner , my friends turned a blind eye to me .
I quickly took the bag and surreptitiously left the shopping center while looking for my friends .
Since I could n't find them , I went straight home as if nothing had happened .
When I reached my bedroom , I saw that the exotic boxes I had thought held jewelry actually contained banknotes .
I actually thought it was a dream . When I reacted , I had been as quiet as a mouse for two minutes .
What should I do ?
Should I take the money and pretend nothing happened , or should I try to give the bag back ?
Finally , my regrets convinced me to do a good deed .
While researching how to return the money , I found someone 's phone number ; we were actually planning to meet when I ran into him on the street .
It was my neighbour !
I gave him the bag and , proud of myself , went back home thinking about what would have happened if I , selfishly , had kept the money .
The question of a single Europe , and whether it implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain , has been the subject of considerable debate for some time .
Last November , one of the principal reasons underlying Mrs Thatcher 's resignation was her opposition to increased involvement in Europe .
Her view was not shared by many of her party colleagues , who , on the contrary , were conscious of an all-too-pressing need for Britain to play an active role in a united Europe .
January 1993 is expected to see the creation of the single European market .
The aims of such a union are essentially economic .
All trade barriers will be broken down so as to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of Europe , in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
In order to facilitate trade between the different nations , many people are in favour of adopting a common currency , namely the ECU .
This , in turn , would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .
Although primarily created as an economic union , a single Europe will necessarily have political implications .
The European Parliament , of course , already exists , but many people envisage that in a single Europe it will play a more important role and its powers will be extended , possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .
For supporters of a single Europe , the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . They would argue , first and foremost , that Britain can not afford to go it alone and that it is in its interests to join forces with the rest of Europe .
Critics of the European Union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower that will undermine Britain 's sovereignty in these areas .
Personally , I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other European countries , all of which have long been in favour of such a union .
Moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favourable and will bring about increased productivity and prosperity .
However , I feel hesitant about the prospect of a common currency , at least until such time as it becomes necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of Britain 's economic sovereignty .
Yet I am even more opposed to taking political directives from Brussels .
If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments , our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger , and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty .
Academic culture differs from one country to another , so it is the most important and challenging task for international students to adjust to Australia 's academic culture for effective learning .
During my studies , I have found a vast difference in academic culture between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , memorising lessons and rote learning form the basis of higher education .
In contrast , in Australia students are supposed to use online resources for research , referencing , independent study , and critical thinking .
At the beginning , I felt really uncomfortable using online resources and found it difficult to develop my own perspective and to present a reasoned argument .
However , studying in Australian academic culture is an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience .
There are definite reasons for the differences in the academic cultures of Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , university teachers hardly get training , orientation , and research opportunities to update their knowledge , so they stick to traditional teaching methods .
( Teijlingen & Simkhada , 2010 ) .
As a result , the students are unable to access research literature despite their strong academic success .
On the other hand , in Australia , courses like EAP are usually designed to improve students ' academic language proficiency and relevant study skills that will help them throughout their academic lives .
( Budley )
Thus , skill-based learning is more useful in our academic lives .
In conclusion , to enhance my learning at university , I will access the available resources for my research , improve my note-taking skills , interact with teachers and peers in class , attend lectures , and work hard to be an independent learner .
Among recent issues , there have been major problems caused by the number of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today .
The high volume of traffic on the roads causes heavy congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London and the M61 into Manchester ; this stop-and-go movement on British motorways has increased gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere , which will eventually cause global warming .
A few suggestions have been made to remedy these problems , but with no great effect .
A number of these are listed below .
An allowance for better access to Britain 's main industrial centres through the construction of large and substantial highways .
A limited number of HGV operators are submitting only a few lorries from their fleets to be used on British roads .
A kind of catalytic converter for diesel engines that reduces some of the harmful emissions .
Another idea is for the government to introduce a tolling system for motorways and main A roads .
One final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to require heavy goods to be transported only by rail .
Here are only a few suggestions of how to convert British roads , but just these few would be a cause for debate .
The problem with these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .
Take the first suggestion , for example : a network of routes to all major industrial cities would cost billions , because it costs £1 million per mile of motorway .
If there were only a limited number of HGV operators , it would drive a lot of people out of business , and that would n't be in the best interest of the government .
A catalytic converter for diesel engines is a good idea , but it would only reduce gas emissions , not congestion .
All the suggestions I have made have problems , which is why we still have issues on our roads today .
Dear Sirs and Madams ,
My name is Edda Preuß . I am from Germany , and I finished my A-levels this year .
To get some new inspiration and ideas about what I would like to do in the future , I planned to take a road trip through the USA .
My plans suddenly changed when I read your advertisement for the job at the summer camp .
I am a very open-minded person .
I love to travel and to explore different cultures .
Furthermore , I do many sports , such as swimming , running , and dancing—Flamenco , Zumba , and hip hop .
I have already worked with children , both as a swimming teacher for children aged 4 to 7 and as an intern at a primary school in my town .
I loved to organize all sorts of activities , parties and meals .
I hope you share my opinion that I am the perfect candidate for the job you are offering .
I am looking forward to meeting you personally .
Best regards
Edda Preuß
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I was pleased to see your recently released report on municipal waste collection , as I have long been interested in the data it contains .
It was also great to see that the percentage of landfilled waste is lower than in other regions , and I was particularly glad that the utilisation of waste to recover heat and power has at least begun , even though it still represents a negligible proportion of overall waste treatment .
It is my firm conviction that the proportion of recycled waste must increase in the coming years , while the amount of waste sent to landfills should be reduced to avoid the detrimental effects on the health of the local population .
Because of this , I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decision-making , since they are likely to have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment and are eager to utilise recycled raw materials in their manufacturing processes .
It is imperative that you give my proposal serious consideration because the growing number of illnesses caused by toxic waste in the soil is increasing the municipality 's social security expenditures and ruining the lives of local families .
Yours sincerely ,
Carlo Paole
Genetic manipulation has been going on for many centuries in the form of selective breeding of both crops and animals .
This technique has been of great benefit to the human race , enabling the production of more and better food and new , interesting varieties .
Of course , selective breeding has not just benefited food ; it has also aided the development of different natural fibres , such as wool and cotton .
It is only very recently that genetic manipulation has been seen to have both good and bad sides .
This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way .
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad or good use ; they simply wanted to find out what it was all about and hence can not be blamed for any later events .
Today , much research is being carried out into human genes to find out how they work and whether they can be altered to prevent disease .
The scientists who work on this can not be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends—for example , in biological warfare or to eliminate a 'gay ' or 'criminal ' gene that may be present in human embryos .
However , scientists can be blamed in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes .
These are now available in a supermarket near you ; their genes have been altered to increase redness , juiciness , or resistance to disease .
These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other genetically engineered food , prove to cause a terrible disease , then that is the fault of the scientist who developed them , because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe .
Similarly , if genetically engineered vaccines or medicines prove to have harmful side effects , that is because they were not adequately tested before being released on the market , and the scientists are to blame .
To Whom It May Concern :
I am writing this letter because I believe I am a suitable candidate for this job .
I love working with kids , and I have a lot of experience taking care of them and organizing different activities .
I love working in the kitchen , and I am an excellent cook .
Sincerely ,
Natalia
Everyone knows that famous people have hard lives .
They are constantly on my mind , at the center of my attention .
Famous people do not actually have personal time .
Is it right ?
In my opinion , no . I think these people deserve freedom .
Celebrities have two lives .
First , life is for society and the press .
Second Life is private , without cameras and journalists .
Like most people , they want silence and rest after a hard day .
Sometimes journalists wait for their " victims " around houses and restaurants .
It is not very nice .
Often they are asked dirty and unpleasant questions .
Famous people also want to spend time with family and friends .
I think to solve this problem we need to indicate the time and place where a famous person will give an interview .
Police can arrest journalists if they conduct an interview in the wrong place .
I think this would facilitate the lives of famous people .
For one thing , they are people , not machines .
The National Lottery was introduced in Britain in November 1994 .
Since the first draw , it has become increasingly popular , involving millions of people across the country each week .
The proposal for a lottery brought about many objections and complaints .
There were , and still are , two principal concerns that the anti-National Lottery campaigners have .
For people in high society , a flutter on the National Lottery each week has no effect on their financial position .
These kinds of people can afford to spend £10–£20 a week .
The concern lies with — and I use the term lightly — 'working-class citizens ' .
These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery .
The problem is that these working and unemployed men and women do spend money they ca n't afford .
The second problem is the encouragement of gambling .
The National Lottery , after all , is another gambling game .
The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million , and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
It is gambling , but more importantly , it is gambling made available to 16-year-olds .
Many gambling problems stem from scratch cards associated with the lottery .
These can be purchased easily , and the attraction is right on the spot .
The thought of being rich instantly encourages gamblers , young and old , including underage people , to purchase tickets .
The National Lottery , however , has its good points .
There is one main advantage to the lottery .
It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible .
From buying a very expensive piece of stimulating equipment for a young child with brain problems to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland Islands , the lottery has helped young and old far and wide .
The lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending , and made many people dream about what it would be like to be rich .
The National Lottery has its good points and its bad points .
Deciding whether it should have been introduced is very much a personal matter and depends on how highly you rate the points I have emphasised in this essay .
I believe it is a benefit to the country .
Dear Student Film Club ,
I thought I might help you choose an awesome movie for the club .
A thriller , actually .
I absolutely loved this one because of its amazing actors , Leonardo DiCaprio and Blake Lively .
They played a married couple in their early thirties who had just moved into a lake house .
Of course , after a few weeks , strange things started happening .
At night , they heard weird noises and moans coming from the lake .
Furthermore , the woman started to see shadows and movements around the water .
And it only got worse .
I do n't want to give you a huge spoiler and ruin everything , so I 'm only going to tell you that it 's going to get pretty sick .
Someone is going to die and there is going to be a lot of blood .
I really recommend watching this thriller .
If you have the guts , you will love it just as much as I did .
Until next time , Lea .
Hi Jo ,
I am so glad to hear from you .
I am very happy because you have decided to come to my city .
This is a great idea because it means we could spend some time together .
First of all , I would like to know how you are going to travel .
From your city to mine you can travel by plane , train , or bus ; whatever you choose , there are connections to the city center , although for me the fastest way is traveling by plane .
From the airport , you can take buses , trains , or the Underground to the city in less than half an hour .
Travelling within the city is quite expensive ; however , if you get a one-day travel card , you will save money .
Although getting a job is a bit harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for the summer .
You can try to get a job as a waitress in a fast-food restaurant or as a retail assistant in a shopping center .
I hope this helps you .
See you .
The author uses a third-person narrator , employing third-person pronouns such as " his " or " their . "
The story is seen through Susan 's eyes .
The narrator knows her feelings and thoughts and can see what she sees , but he does not know any of the other characters ' thoughts or feelings .
One point that shows this is the scene in which Susan talks to Annie and wonders what Annie might think of her plan to save the dog .
From all these points , one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
Another point to analyse is the mode of presentation .
The short story mainly uses scenic presentation .
The events are described in detail , for example , when every step of Susan 's is described .
The only exception , in which the mode of presentation is panoramic , occurs when the events of the holidays are summed up in the second paragraph .
Furthermore , the story contains both external and internal action , such as the interior monologue , in which the reader gets to know all of Susan 's thoughts in detail .
Save Billy is a short story written in an informal register , recognizable by its use of informal words such as " kiddies " and contractions like " did n't " and " is n't . "
The aim of this study is to examine research trends in Revista Educação Especial from 2010 to 2013 and to identify the most developed , undeveloped , or absent research themes during that period .
The selection of the journal is justified because it has a broad , well-established reach and publishes only articles on Special Education .
This is a bibliographic study with qualitative and quantitative approaches .
The articles analyzed were accessed from the journal 's website , resulting in 134 articles .
The collected information was organized into frameworks outlining developed themes and indicating the number of articles discussing each subject ; the institution was also tabulated , as well as whether the article included participants and who those participants were .
The results showed that the institutions publishing the most in the journal are the Universidade Federal de São Carlos and the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria ; the majority of studies do not report participants , followed by studies describing interventions conducted with professionals .
The most published topics are Special Education and School Inclusion ; the least published are prevention and defining disability .
It has been noticed that some disabilities are poorly studied or lack effective interventions ; for example , among global developmental disorders there is a great focus on autism but little or almost nothing is presented about the other conditions in this group .
Another example concerns articles dealing with the issue of deafness , of which only one in twelve is associated with cochlear implantation .
The doorbell rang .
Imagine my surprise when I opened the door and saw Maria Shaw , my favourite singer , standing in front of me .
She looked as beautiful as she had in her clips , though a bit worried .
I need help . I am completely lost and need to get to Valencia .
" Furthermore , my car is broken , " she said , and I replied , " There 's no problem . "
I 'm going to take you to your concert .
It was very exciting because nobody had ever visited me at my cottage before , but that day my luck changed .
In my journey with Maria , I asked her a lot of questions .
She was very friendly and made a lot of jokes .
She invited me to the concert , and it was wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they had been sold in less than an hour .
The best moment of the night was when she dedicated a song to me , and later she invited me to supper with all her staff .
What a marvellous woman I met that day !
I think many people travel by car because it 's easy , but when you 're on the road in your own car , there are a lot of disadvantages .
One of these is traffic : if you take the tube , you probably wo n't be stuck in a traffic jam for long and you 'll move faster underground .
In my opinion , people have hardly recognized the true potential of public transport .
Many of them think that traveling in their own car is better .
The high number of cars is really damaging to the environment , and pollution increases every day .
I hope there will be a future in which public transport is more effective than the car .
I think there are advantages and disadvantages to cars .
An advantage is that you can go wherever you want by car , but a big disadvantage is traffic .
Another disadvantage is finding parking for the car in city centers .
Public transport also has advantages and disadvantages .
For example , public transport has designated stops , and it is sometimes a little late .
But a big advantage , especially for the underground , is the complete absence of traffic .
Old computers were much bigger and more complicated to use than recent ones .
They could n't access the Internet , since there simply was n't such a thing .
You had to control the device by typing instructions in specific ways that few people knew about .
There were n't any mice , and it was impossible to connect anything wirelessly .
One could only play a small number of games on old computers .
All of these features failed to make computers very popular among the general public ; computers were used almost exclusively by scientists and mathematicians .
Nobody would use them nowadays !
They were far less practical and comfortable than our current everyday devices .
In fact , there is no future for public transport .
As far as public transport is concerned , there does not seem to be a way forward unless it can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
In my view , the types of transport we are accustomed to will gradually diminish .
On the other hand , the automotive industry has managed to create efficient electric cars that do not need petrol .
This is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the development of public transport .
Each year there are more and more new electric models from Toyota and other brands .
Far from being solely beneficial to the environment , this development is also positive for travellers , who will see a significant reduction in travel costs with these new cars , which is causing a direct decrease in the use of public transport .
At this point , one thing seems clear for the public transport industries : their future depends on their ability to obtain more efficient trains , buses , and planes .
Why ?
There are two reasons : prices and environmental protection .
Yesterday , I was on the beach with my grandpa and my dog Willi .
Willi is a beautiful two-year-old poodle that I got as a Christmas present .
Well , Willi likes hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into the water .
Immediately , Willi turned and ran for the stick .
He was back in a minute .
Then a strange man came to us .
He was tall and slim , and he was wearing a coat .
He kept a stick in his hand , but his stick was bigger than my grandpa 's .
When he saw Willi , he also threw his stick into the water and wanted Willi to bring it back .
But he did n't want to catch the man 's stick , so he turned around and walked away .
Of course we left with him .
The man was shouting at us to come back for a minute , but then he stopped .
The stick was still floating on the water , so he had no choice but to jump into the water to get it .
Although the man was angry , it was very funny to us .
Do you agree or disagree ?
The more money people have , the more they should give away for charity .
Nowadays , more and more people are discussing whether a person who possesses more money has a responsibility to help others .
Donate more money to charity .
Some people think that the more money a rich man has , the more useless it becomes , so he should give it away .
He gave away a portion of his fortune to charity .
By doing this , he can use them to maximum effect . I can not agree .
With this idea .
There are numerous reasons to support me .
Money can be used not only to donate to charity but also to enjoy a comfortable daily life .
If we want to live .
To live longer , we have to maintain a happy mind every day .
To maintain a happy state of mind , someone should shop every day .
When they ...
When they see what they want to buy , they buy it without the slightest hesitation .
Therefore , they can be happy .
Live every day .
In addition to buying what you want , money can be used to build a more wonderful world .
There are many .
Diseases that ca n't be cured .
Therefore , rich men can use their fortune to build a group made of the
We need an excellent biological scientist to research new , useful medicines to save more dying people .
Furthermore , giving money to charity is not a privilege reserved for rich people ; ordinary people can do it too .
Donate money to a philanthropic organization .
Some people think that living a plain life is the best thing for them .
Therefore , ordinary people contribute a portion of their wealth to charity and lead simple lives .
It is .
They are so kind that they have great lives every day .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for the position of Cook , as seen in your advertisement .
I am a 25-year-old girl and a student .
I love cooking .
I am interested in many exotic cultures , for example Chinese and Japanese cuisines .
What drew us to Facebook ?
More than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many of them bemoan Facebook as a time-suck , even though they could spend that time more productively on work , schoolwork , or face-to-face time with family and friends .
But something keeps drawing us in : Facebook can boost our self-esteem , satisfy our need for connectedness and self-promotion , and help us maintain offline relationships .
But we do n't use Facebook in the same way . There are the sociable , the lonely , and the narcissistic ; they go on Facebook to satisfy different needs .
The university psychologist , Stefan Hofmann , found that we use Facebook to satisfy two needs .
On the one hand , we need to belong , and on the other , we need to present ourselves .
Facebook satisfies both of those basic needs , says Hofmann .
Some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connections .
But other people think that Facebook makes us lonely and removes contact with real friends .
Social psychologist Sheldon found that spending a lot of time on Facebook is associated with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and high levels of disconnection .
A new study suggests that we gain some psychological benefit even from passively viewing our own profiles .
In a 2011 study of about 300 college students , researchers Amy Gonzales and Jeffrey Hancock found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self-esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes .
The researchers suspect this is because we can self-select what other people can see on our profiles .
Facebook can help people discover information they might otherwise miss , such as a new job opportunity or a news story .
The more different kinds of people you have in your network , the better your chances are of getting useful information .
Researchers believe social networking is likely to continue growing .
The doorbell rang .
Imagine my surprise when I opened the door .
I was shocked .
He looked like Luke Guina .
I wondered how that could really be .
I looked at him and he looked at me .
I was sure , totally sure .
He sang in my favourite band .
I cried , " Oh my fucking God , you are Luke Guina , right ? I am probably your biggest fan . "
How can it be that I meet you at our school ?
I have been to so many concerts , and have never had the chance to speak to you .
He laughed and answered , " Wow , I did n't think anyone knew me at this school . "
Well , my band is not very famous right now , but thank you for the compliments .
I am really glad for them .
I will go to school here from now on . We had a nice conversation , and I finally found a very good friend in Luke .
I love the music of his band , and maybe I will be part of the group as a second singer .
I would like to write about my family .
I am a mother of two grown-up children .
I work part-time in a laboratory as a specimen receptionist .
I have been working there for almost nine years .
I came to the United Kingdom in 2004 with my husband and my children .
My husband came here as a student to study for his PhD . At first , I was the only one in the family who earned an income .
Because of that , it was hard to meet our young children 's daily needs .
At that time my daughter was a teenager .
Initially , she had to struggle to adjust to a completely new environment .
But I am happy to say that after ten years of hardship , my husband managed to find a proper job , and my daughter has become a sensible , smart woman . At the moment , she is studying for a degree in developmental physiology .
Dear Grace ,
You had a bad accident that changed your life forever .
It 's normal to feel depressed right now and to think life is n't worth living , but you should think about all the beautiful things you can still do , even if you do them in a different way .
You need to think positively and try to enjoy yourself . Do n't think about the past ; live your life in the present . Do n't be discouraged , and do n't let this problem change your life .
Even if it seems impossible to be optimistic , it depends only on you ; you need to want it .
To determine whether crime pays , one should first define what is meant by the word " pays . "
If a person gains $ 100 from a jewelry store theft , yet uses $ 10 worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window , pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 on a hotel room to hide out , then his crime has actually left him $ 10 in the hole .
However , the question of whether crime pays requires a deeper notion of " pay " than simple dollars-and-cents accounting .
In criminal work , pay must be weighed as gains from crime against all resulting losses .
One issue to consider is the type of capital loss illustrated above .
Crime , like any small business , requires an investment .
One investment is time .
If the time involved in planning and committing a crime does not pay off in a gain that justifies the time expenditure , then the crime has not paid off .
Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field .
If a criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then committing a crime can earn enough to justify the time spent .
If a criminal is well-educated and could work in a profession , then his crimes must bring in more money .
Other capital investments in crime could include equipment such as getaway cars , dynamite , weaponry , and disguises .
Mafia and police payoffs could be involved .
Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting the money earned with other parties involved .
The income from a crime must be enough to cover all these expenditures .
Another type of loss to consider is the loss of mental and physical health and well-being .
Many times , violence is part of crime .
The cost of being shot or stabbed in the leg is more than just the medical bills .
It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again .
Very few criminals have workers ' compensation .
The stress that comes from the constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself and can lessen both a person 's lifespan and enjoyment of life .
Legal problems could become both a capital loss and a health-related loss .
Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the financial cost of a more expensive lawyer , they might pay for it with their health if imprisoned .
Even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal entanglements can be very stressful and unhealthy .
Does crime pay ?
In some cases it may , but the small-business criminal must deal with the same risks as the legitimate businessman .
Larger criminal corporations will always seek to drive him out of business , and he may have to work long hours for small gains .
However , he does better than the legitimate businessman on one count : no taxes .
In my hometown of Kalamazoo , the invention of the shopping mall has changed both the lives of its residents and the town itself .
While many people enjoy and use shopping malls , I believe they are more of a detriment than a blessing .
Kalamazoo , like most American cities , began to develop around its central means of transportation .
Cities were first located near water , then near train tracks , and later began to be located farther away due to the invention of trucks and cars .
Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful district .
Near the train station were the larger industries and other specialized stores essential for everyday supplies .
Homes and neighborhoods were located outside the central city . However , many stores had several floors of apartments above them to house families .
Everyone was near the central city , so they could use it .
Rich and poor alike had easy access to the offerings of the central city .
Throughout history , the trend has been for the rich to get richer and the poor to remain poor .
While the rich got richer , they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside of the city limits .
Wealthier people moved from the inner city ( thanks to the invention of the automobile ) to the suburbs , where they could keep their distance from the busy inner city .
While wealthier residents began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working-class residents remained because they lacked transportation or money to move outward .
This process has left the businesses in the inner cities , including Kalamazoo , without a stable clientele .
Why should we , say , those with cars , go downtown where poorer people have to shop outdoors , going from one specialized store to another , when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did , and still do , relocate to strip malls near the main malls or to the malls themselves .
I believe that only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or who enjoy the downtown district remain in business .
Many larger factories and office buildings still remain downtown .
The executives and businesspeople commute to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once a thriving neighborhood .
And still could be !
One feature that does attract business is the presence of colleges .
Kalamazoo has one large university , one private college , and two community 2-year colleges .
" colleges . "
The large and private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kalamazoo , so many businesses try to cater to our tastes : clubs , cafés , and other stores .
Downtown festivals are another attempt to reinstate success .
We have many of them , and they always attract people from the suburbs .
This disintegration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects—the poor and the lower-middle class .
Their neighborhoods do n't get financial support , and money is not spent in the stores near them .
If they had more money and could leave , the majority would .
Shopping malls , strip malls , and the flight from the inner cities by upper-class Americans will ultimately hurt those who ca n't escape ; in fact , it is already hurting businesses and lives in the downtown districts .
Hello .
Firstly , I would like to introduce myself : I 'm 32 years old and I 'm from Poland .
The first time I checked this website , I thought it was too difficult .
It 's new for me , but today I will try to write something using this .
Website .
I chose this subject , but I have no idea what I should write .
So .
Maybe I 'll try to write you something about myself .
This is what I do in my life and why I 'm here .
First and most importantly , what I want to say is that I have
I started learning English two years ago .
Privately , I 'm working as a firefighter ; it 's attractive , but also very ...
A dangerous profession .
English is really important to me , and I feel much better when I speak it .
I go somewhere and can talk with people from different places .
Country .
I often travel , so from time to time I use English .
The .
A second reason I 'm trying to learn this language is that I need it .
In my work .
I remembered the situation : it was two years ago when some firefighters arrived .
People from England visited my company , and they stayed in Poland for two weeks .
We went with them to some kind of social event .
This could change our experience with them .
I felt really bad when I could n't cooperate with the team .
England .
That is why I 'm here ; my friend from Poland sent me your address .
So , thanks for your help .
Best wishes , Patrick .
Advancements in technology have a major influence on transportation systems , and the new roadways make travel more convenient .
As personal transportation offers people more convenient options , public transport systems are losing market share .
The market for personal vehicles has become cheaper and safer than before , and a major increase in growth has been observed .
Nowadays , as people become more professional , they are keen to save their valuable time by switching from scheduled public transport to personal cars . Luxury and speed have become status symbols for car owners , and they also provide a way to avoid public interaction and annoyance .
The new multitasking lifestyle better suits the preference for personal cars , allowing people to keep and carry all the things they need .
Since Maggie 's class won a prize in the basketball game , their teacher took them to a nature reserve to observe animals .
Maggie and her best friends were so excited that they kept taking pictures with animals .
Halfway through the tour , they went to the hippo area .
Fortunately , the mother hippo gave birth last month .
The baby hippo was so cute that Maggie wanted to take a picture of it up close .
However , little Maggie knew that the mother was nearby and assumed that she was attacking her baby .
The mother ran out of the river and chased after Maggie .
When the teacher saw the scene , she called the reserve staff to save Maggie from the horrible hippo .
After a few minutes , several strong men came to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart .
It was such good fortune that no one was injured .
Nevertheless , Maggie sincerely regretted being a troublemaker .
She has vowed that she will stay away from wild animals , no matter how gentle they may look .
During the 20th century , several worldwide discoveries significantly influenced people 's lives .
I think the most significant discovery or invention depends on the individual .
Every individual holds a different perspective on life and on what they consider valuable and important .
I chose cultural awareness and an understanding of prejudice and discrimination as my topic because I greatly value all of humanity and believe that everyone should learn to live in peace .
Cultural and racial equality are goals that we , as a society , are striving for .
People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today 's society .
As individuals , we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminatory media language and advertising .
In the past , this type of discrimination , which includes not only Black Americans but also other ethnicities and women , has been accepted as a way of life .
Few individuals have been courageous enough to challenge deeply ingrained stereotypes and inequality and to demand freedom and equality .
Numerous hidden talents , strong , wise , personal voices , and the great knowledge and learning that result from human experience and suffering have been buried under our society 's ignorance .
However , today we are beginning to move in a new direction .
People understand that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned , but must be unlearned .
Together , as a society and as part of a much larger world , we are recognizing the value of learning from differences .
Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed ; rather , they are being celebrated .
Meetings and forums are currently being held to find new ways to address discrimination and racism .
The opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up , and the availability to study cultural differences and reflect on that knowledge is improving .
Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery , but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existence of all humanity .
As human beings , we need each other , and we need to be willing to accept those who are different .
The main advantage of being famous is that you have more privileges than other people , such as entering places without waiting in line or , in some cases , not having to pay your bill .
On the other hand , in my opinion , it has more bad things than good ones .
Everyone can recognize you , and they might bother you to ask for your signature .
So you ca n't move freely anywhere , and you have to hide to rest away from the crowds .
That 's all , in my view .
Hello , I 'm Alisa , a 27-year-old Italian woman . I would like to apply for this job opportunity because my dream is to go to the USA .
Moreover , this way seems perfect for realising it .
I believe I would be a suitable candidate for your staff because I already have experience working with children and enjoy it ; they are so genuine and imaginative , and you do n't work for them but with them .
I adore children , and they usually love me .
I 'm a cheerful , willing , educated person .
Italian is my mother tongue , and I have a good level of English and French .
I have been playing volleyball for 12 years . I attended a theatre course and have a degree in fine arts , so I will be able to organise sports and creative activities easily .
Furthermore , I have a pastry degree and I 'm not afraid to work in the kitchen . Cooking and baking are some of my favorite hobbies .
I hope my application will be considered .
Best regards ,
Alisa
For as long as people have been alive , they have invented things .
Important early discoveries included the wheel and fire .
In the long line of such discoveries , modern man has continuously found new ways to make his life easier .
So , naturally , when the washing machine was invented , millions of lives were made simpler .
The washing machine , in those houses that own one , has almost become a necessity .
Should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furiously running about in the streets , clutching their machines tightly to their chests .
In today 's society , being without a washing machine or any other electrical gadget seems devastating .
What would a college student do without a washing machine ?
Where would we find the time to hand wash our clothes ?
The mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers , students , and adults alike .
This modern invention , the washing machine , has put the fear of washing clothes by hand into the hearts of many .
Give an average adult a washboard and soap , tell them to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on their face .
Thus , it is easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , toaster ovens , and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives , they also contribute to our tendency to rush around .
These " wonders " make it easier to spend less time on manual labor .
But is that all that bad ?
Many housewives would insist on its benefits , and I would have to agree .
But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet do n't allow us to exercise or use our muscles .
It is no small wonder that in today 's modern society , as we continually use our modern gadgets , we increasingly need diet programs and other such systems .
Yes , the old days were hard , but was Weight Watchers ever an issue ?
Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .
This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss .
First , we should take into account that parents are n't usually specialists in all fields of study : even if they have a degree in history , they may not know how to help their children with a math problem .
Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces opportunities to meet new people and make friends .
This is n't good for the children because they wo n't be socializing , and when it comes time for a job interview , they wo n't know how to behave .
On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students who , due to their complicated situations—such as an illness— can not go to school like other children .
To sum up , I believe that children should attend school if their families can afford it , because in most cases parents do not have the same knowledge as teachers .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era ; it is also one of the most deadly .
During a fight , a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head , and each time he is punched , he loses more and more brain cells .
The brain is encased in the skull , but it is not protected only by the skull ; a liquid shock absorber also protects the brain .
Even though there is the protective liquid , the brain still gets bounced against the skull , damaging it more and more with each impact .
A boxer who has been boxing for a number of years—ten , for example—and then retires is very likely to have brain damage ; it could be very severe or barely noticeable , but the damage is still there .
Turning from long-term to short-term effects : yes , brain cells can still be killed , but when a boxer receives a very strong punch directly to the face , it can not only damage his nose , eyes , teeth , and other facial features , but also cause him to enter a coma , suffer a hemorrhage , or die .
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top-ranked boxers receive .
The question that people have is whether that person is really worth several million pounds .
This is just for a fight against another top-ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds .
Another aspect of the cost is having so many medical units and doctors at the front when they could be somewhere else—somewhere more important , where people are n't being paid to fight .
The major influence keeping boxing going is the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport . There is an incredibly high demand for it .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports , and banning it would be difficult .
Not only does boxing satisfy viewers , but many companies also sponsor it , which brings them a lot of advertising and capital .
A study group is a group of people who gather to discuss topics they have chosen .
So if you join a study group , you can understand other people 's ideas and how they think about this problem .
Also , you can exchange your ideas with others so that a discussion can take place .
Through this discussion , I think we can understand our own thinking and others ' opinions more clearly .
Another benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and methodically ; in other words , your speaking skills will improve .
However , why do some people still study on their own ?
In my opinion , I need to consider a question deeply on my own .
Sometimes too many other thoughts disturb me .
Maybe I 'll become a person who only listens to others ' ideas and never thinks for myself if I rely too much on study groups .
Joining study groups is a good way to boost your motivation to learn , but do n't forget that sometimes you need to spend time alone and calmly reflect on what you have learned .
My favourite sport is football ; I first saw it nine years ago and liked it so much .
It was a game between Chelsea and Bolton , and Chelsea won 5–1 .
I got a lot of new feelings because I had never liked or watched it before .
I noticed that Lampard was a leader of that team , and he scored twice in that game .
I have been supporting Chelsea for nine years , and I assume it was love at first sight .
My advice to people who play is never to give up playing and to keep supporting the club that gave you the chance to play and be part of the team .
Respect your coach even if he is very strict .
You have to put a lot of effort into this stuff if you want to achieve your goals and aims .
You have to be ready to get through a lot of trauma , injuries , and problems that you will encounter on your road to success .
If you put in a lot of effort now and are strong enough to get through it , you will be proud and achieve everything you wanted .
Dear Thomas ,
Recently you asked me about a place you were about to visit .
I think there is a perfect spot for you !
In the heart of Katowice there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
This attic flat was used as a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer Andrzej Urbanowicz , who died a year ago .
The place conceals a fascinating history of underground culture in Silesia .
For quite a long time ( especially in the 1960s ) , the studio was frequented by many bohemian artists who engaged in occult and Buddhist practices and painted psychedelic works .
The apartment was at one point close to Andy Warhol 's famous studio , which he rented in the 1960s in New York City .
Urbanowicz had created a fantastic place , full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and a Far Eastern atmosphere—there were loads of figurines , paintings , old lamps , carpets , and dolls reminiscent of those in horror films such as Child 's Play .
Some time ago , I took the opportunity to experience this magical aura for myself .
Just for once , the apartment had been changed into a temporary cinema for those who came to see Nina Menkes 's film The Phantom Love , which fit in perfectly with the surroundings .
I must say , I ca n't imagine a better place to see and experience the history of Silesian art , so I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart .
Yours sincerely ,
Patrycja .
The only thing that matters is whether you love what you do ; because of this , I have helped you prepare your concert .
I can say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory . You have to like what you do . I helped wholeheartedly because I admire the job .
I gained a lot of experience from my expeditions through many countries and from DJing in clubs , and I felt so good when I saw that many people had gathered at my concert .
I try my best to make people feel good and have fun with my music . All I can say is that I truly love what I do , and that 's why I was able to help you with ease .
I hope you will go and try , and if all goes well , email me back with your successful experiences .
In my area , I have gained all this experience , and I feel like a happy man .
Now that I 've gotten away , I 'm a talented artist .
With respect , I welcome you , friend , and I say again it was a pleasure to help you !
It is said that boxing should be banned as a barbaric sport ; it has been known to cause deaths and brain damage among fighters .
The constant pounding to the head during a match does n't necessarily take its toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , the chances of his sustaining serious brain damage are fairly high .
Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they can no longer stand ? Could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , with children being brought up to 'worship ' idols such as Frank Bruno as he pummels someone into a hazy blur ?
Should boxing be banned ?
My answer to all of these questions is no .
Maybe boxing is brutal , but fighting is part of human nature , and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people from fighting in controlled circumstances .
Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death ?
If boxing were banned , where would we draw the line—skiing ?
Mountaineering ?
Diving ?
Darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and a matter of personal opinion whether you watch it or not . Boxing is usually on late at night , and children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
I think boxing should be encouraged . In run-down inner-city areas such as Moss Side , boxing is popular ; it gives young lads a focus in life and a target .
Many of the best boxers came from such areas ; in my opinion , they are better off boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs , or shooting each other .
Banning boxing is simply unnecessary ; if it were banned , it would simply continue underground .
This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport , as expert medical attention and proper match control would not be ensured ; the use of pads might also be ignored .
The only suitable action would be to increase safety regulations .
We should require head guards and better gloves in all fights , or shorten the length of fights to cut down on some of the constant pounding .
Getting entertained !
Throughout history , sports have been one of the many entertaining things to watch .
The international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention , and I would like to present my life on a plate .
Firstly , most of us enjoy watching football .
Is there always someone who wo n't stop commenting on the unbelievable new situation in the match ?
Even though I am a girl , football is one of the main sports I watch on TV .
My eyes sparkle when I 'm waiting for a goal to end the match or when a red card is unfairly given .
The second one would be skiing .
I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practise it .
It is amazing that they are prepared for many obstacles and for racing against the clock to the finish line .
You need to focus , have a lot of energy , and , above all , strength .
Not everyone is able to cope with that , and this should be recognized .
Are you thinking of an influence on the way sports developed ?
In my opinion , tradition remains even in the 21st century , and sports differ from country to country .
On the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertains people from all over the world .
When banknotes are produced , the background colour , artwork , and security features should be designed carefully .
Then skilled machinists prepare and manipulate the metal plates .
What 's more , printing is a very important step in thinking about sheets , colour , special ink , and so on .
The most important step is inspection .
In this step , it would produce good-quality sheets , bad sheets , and partially damaged sheets .
The good portions of partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate banknotes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution alongside good-quality sheets .
The bad sheets and parts will be destroyed for disposal .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve a private life without journalists constantly following them .
I definitely agree with this statement .
We are all human .
That means everyone deserves privacy .
It does not matter who we are , even in public life .
Film stars should sometimes be awarded for their patience when confronted by journalists .
Spicy news about politicians and other celebrities , such as film stars , is most sought after in our lives today .
The truth is that politicians should take responsibility for their decisions in government and take into consideration the words they say .
It also covers film stars , because to a young nation they are the last word .
In my opinion , there should be some clear boundaries that paparazzi can not cross .
They should n't hound celebrities during their holidays or when they have family or other personal problems .
People today feed on gossip .
We live in the 21st century , so people who decide to be public figures should be wary of intrusive photographers and pushy paparazzi who want to poke their noses into their private lives by any means .
One of the most incredible 20th-century discoveries , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .
Many people buy them to take wherever they go so they can receive calls at any time .
They are a complete luxury and not a necessity .
The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways : the main one is the ability to be reached at any time .
Communication is now readily available in cars and on the streets .
People can use their car phones in case of an emergency , such as when they are stranded or their car breaks down .
They can take their cellular phones on vacation and to their friends ' houses if they are expecting an important call .
To me , it is a bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone .
Another way in which cellular telephones have affected people 's lives is the increased accident rate among people who talk on their car phones .
When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .
This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them .
Cellular phones also have negative aspects .
Cellular telephones are also very expensive .
They are expensive to buy , install , and use .
Whether you are making or receiving a call on your cell phone , it costs a lot of money .
Most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone can afford to pay the bills .
The other day I called my father in his office from Madrid ; on his " party line " he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone .
I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with four people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car !
It is truly a sign of significant technological expansion .
Each year , a new , amazing product astonishes me even more .
I am starting to wonder when we will have robots cleaning our house and driving us around .
The scary thing is that it 's just around the corner !
My most memorable experience was a trip to Hue with my family .
When I entered the university , my parents decided to treat me to a wonderful trip .
I felt amazing because my family had made interesting memories together .
I spent one week in an ancient city .
I visited many sights in Hue , such as the peaceful Perfume River , Trang Tien Bridge , Thien Mu Pagoda , and the like .
Moreover , I learned more about Vietnamese history by visiting the beautiful tombs of the Nguyen kings .
In particular , I have experience making nón lá , a beautiful symbol of the Vietnamese people .
I learned about one of Vietnam 's traditional crafts .
Furthermore , I enjoyed many dishes with ethnic flavors .
Besides , I had dinner on an imperial boat and enjoyed Nhã nhạc Cung đình Huế .
In 2005 , UNESCO recognized it as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity .
I am proud of Vietnamese culture .
This was an excellent experience for me .
Through it , I 'd broaden my knowledge of its cultures , religions , customs , and the like .
It was special ; it brought me beautiful emotions and memories with my family .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement in the Jornal da Madeira on Wednesday , 14 February . I would appreciate it if you would send me a more detailed description of your English course .
Could you give me information about the schedule , the number of students in a group , and the tuition cost ?
Moreover , it is important to me that teachers are native speakers .
I am interested in joining the course , particularly the B2 level .
Do you have any vacancies in the group ?
Also , I would like to know whether you accept the results of my tests confirming my knowledge , or whether I will have to take the test at your school .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Nadya Razorenova
My favorite sport is tennis .
In my free time , I like to watch plays from around the world on television .

As a first example , we apply the methodology and tools of network analysis to the study of political networks to optimize the interactions among various international actors .
In the second case , we examine the results of network analyses of the university 's partnerships .
The university identifies the key areas of its activity to contribute to the development of the territory .
Over the past few years , our monarchy has gone from one scandal to the next , from one disaster to another .
The British public has been made to realise that the Royal Family runs just like any normal family , only with a lot more money .
Many people are now questioning the worth of even retaining the monarchy .
Not so long ago , people thought that our royals were carefree and lived ideal lives .
That way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah Ferguson into the family .
No sooner had she married Prince Andrew than things started to go wrong .
Public scandal surrounded their relationship , and their break-up represented the start of a downhill run for the monarchy .
Only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife , Princess Diana , had been given the Queen 's permission to divorce , we were shown that no family is perfect .
Their separation , of course , followed Charles 's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles .
People say we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one another , and many people certainly think that Prince Charles has no right to become king .
Many people argue that we can not afford a monarchy , even though the Queen now pays taxes .
This was highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle , for which taxpayers had to foot the bill .
I personally feel that we should retain the monarchy .
They are our country 's heritage , and other countries envy us for our monarchy .
They give our country something to be proud of . Who has never dreamed of being a royal ?
About me
Hi , I 'm Adal Reuterswärd , and I 'm 13 years old ; I 'll be 14 in January .
I have two sisters : Siri , who is 11 years old , and Lotte , who is 2 years old . Lotte is very annoying .
None of us were born in Danderyd ; we moved here when I was four and have lived here since .
Before that , I think we lived in Sollentuna or something . I 'm not sure .
I love skiing , which I do two or three times a week , sometimes four .
But only in the winter , of course . I also dance on Mondays ; then I practice at home and play the guitar .
Also , I love to paint and watch a lot of TV shows , like Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee , and more .
They 're all American , so I 'm kind of used to it ; that 's how I prefer to speak .
My favorite is The Vampire Diaries ; it 's the most exciting , but I think the next episode comes out on October third , so I have to wait until then .
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really like it there .
My grandparents live there , but they are n't from France . They just moved there .
I do n't know why ; it 's a nice place , I guess .
They moved there with my dad , their other daughter , my aunt , when he was about 14 .
I think my favorite books are the Harry Potter series . I read them a couple of years ago , and after I read the first book we watched the first movie , then we did the same with the second , and so on .
I 'm thinking of reading the books and watching the movies again because I barely remember anything .
But I remember thinking they were so exciting , and after I 'd read the last book , I thought I would never find a good book again .
I did , but none were quite as good as Harry Potter .
I like to listen to a group called Skyscraper , four boys from different parts of Sweden , and to Lucy Hale , an actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first album .
My favorite song of hers is " Road Between . "
I also like Ariana Grande , and I 'm listening to her new album a lot .
First , transport is a very important part of our daily lives . We will talk about the different means of transport .
In the past , the only means of transport were horses , camels , and donkeys ; there were no mechanical vehicles . Riding animals was a safer form of travel than today 's vehicles because there were no exhaust emissions to pollute the air , and the animals ' dung is useful as fertilizer for farmland .
Transport evolved gradually , from bikes and carts to cars with engines .
Today , people use motorized vehicles like motorcycles , cars , trains , and planes .
Although these means are much faster than the previous ones , they pollute our atmosphere .
Vehicle exhausts harm our hearts , affect our breathing , widen the ozone hole , cause a lot of noise , and cause traffic jams .
But people do n't concern themselves with these dangers ; they are concerned only with their luxuries and comfort . I do n't think any new means will be invented .
People are satisfied with engine-powered vehicles , such as cars .
One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century has to do with the speed at which information is now communicated around the globe .
In fact , all improvements in communication have had a profound effect on the way people live .
If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention in the field , it would have to be television .
On television , news and information can be displayed graphically at the very same time they are happening .
This simple fact has changed how we live in many ways and , in a way , continues to shrink the planet we live on .
There are , however , several downsides to television , and , like all inventions , it can be used in a useless way .
Even without considering how much television the average person watches , television has changed people 's lives in several other important ways .
One interesting development has been the use of television in wars .
The Vietnam War was the first time U.S. citizens could really see what it was like to be at war .
This was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting .
We are also able to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and efforts , for instance in Somalia .
Of course , radio was already able to transmit sound , but the advent of the picture has had even greater significance .
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made the dimensions of the planet smaller .
Gone are the days of unknown and unheard-of areas .
Television can bring any part of the world into your living room in a matter of seconds .
It is also a very influential and powerful device , as it is the easiest way to communicate with populations .
Many people feel that it can be harmful , and this is true .
It is also used in ways that can desensitize people to what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real .
Either way it is used , there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century .
The truth is we are all different .
I ca n't speak for others , but in my experience , I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .
First of all , most of us probably do n't know what to do with our lives , or we just do what other people tell us to do , especially our parents .
Second , it is healthy to travel and get to know new cultures and traditions .
But you can do other things , such as working or saving money for college or a new business .
Also , if you have worked before , you 'll have more experience than others , which gives you an advantage .
You will become more independent and more conscious of life in general .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He had to escape as fast as he could .
The police alarm could be heard along the entire street .
So he knew that the police were near .
Michael threw the knife he had in his hand into the bush in front of the house .
He ran faster than ever .
Suddenly , he heard some dogs barking .
At that moment he started feeling really nervous .
He hid under a big car and waited there .
He was afraid and worried about what had happened .
He did n't want to kill his ex-girlfriend .
But Michael had no choice .
Anne had broken up with him over something stupid and irrelevant .
She deserved that .
After a few minutes , he saw someone going into the car where he was hiding .
If he escapes , the person will see him .
Before he could do anything , the car started , and it was too late to leave .
Television is a subtle , magical box that enlightens our lives .
Through the screen , audiences can increase their awareness of events happening around the globe .
Or they can find themselves experiencing a spectrum of emotions they might not encounter in their daily life by watching different movies .
Truly Television symbolizes a dramatic advance in today 's entertainment .
Nevertheless , it can also be billed as a form of education .
Nowadays , when people mention education , the image that comes to mind is of us sitting in front of books , with teachers or computers beside us .
Most books are an inch thick .
Each side is filled with black-and-white images , each followed by a colorless description .
Only in our minds can we imagine objects or ideas described in them .
Televisions , on the other hand , offer a much more colorful learning experience through a mere screen .
Items had been categorized according to their attributes .
Theories and models are combined to explain one of the variations in the world .
For television , however , objects can be expressed in a real-life manner .
Through observation , audiences can understand the variety of their surroundings over time , as well as the correlations among things .
They are given the whole picture and process of our environment , not just a photo .
The lack of natural light in the workplace has become a serious problem , as more people complain about poor relationships with coworkers and declining performance ; inadequate lighting is the main cause .
First of all , not using natural light in the workplace can , in a small but significant way , deteriorate employees ' health because neon lights can affect the eyes and may also cause headaches if used for extended periods .
Because they suffer from headaches , workers are more likely to feel nervous and anxious , and their performance at work may decrease .
Secondly , being in a bad mood can lead to a lack of cooperation and an inability to concentrate and focus on what needs to be done , which also affects productivity and overall well-being in the workplace .
In conclusion , many reasons support employees ' need for access to natural light while working , because its absence can negatively affect both people and productivity ; therefore , it should be taken into consideration and a solution found .

Fame is an asset for every celebrity .
Broadly speaking , being famous means being well-known , and much effort is required to achieve that popularity and be recognised instantly on a TV screen .
It may seem that a person 's image even lives a separate life from its creator , but this is not actually true .
There are several reasons why the image overlaps with its creator .
One reason is that the same actor usually portrays the same character in a succession of films , so the actor blends with their character .
Sometimes the reverse occurs when an actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role in a film or play and becomes associated only with that role .
In short , actors become associated with their roles , and it is not easy for them to change their well-known image , even in their everyday lives .
Regarding other socially-oriented celebrities , other issues arise .
For politicians , keeping a high profile is essential because they are known by their actions .
For journalists , it is essential to appear on programmes to become recognizable .
Overall , these celebrities use their image as a brand for what they do .
To sum up , attention paid to a celebrity is a good sign and indicates that they are truly famous .
Whether they want it or not , journalists pester them and their lives are in the limelight because that 's what people want to know — that 's how being a celebrity works .

Today , most people think that after-school sports clubs are necessary .
However connected with it , advantages and disadvantages exist .
I present it in my essay .
I ask my young friends for their opinion on after-school sports ; some tell me that it is good and some say no .
In the first place , I must say that when young people take part in sports , they are certainly healthier , more athletic , and , of course , fitter , so if you want to be fit , you should take up a sport .
Disadvantages of taking up sports include , for example , that if you get injured you ca n't be active and you may gain weight quickly .
Secondly , when you are exercising or playing , you experience an adrenaline rush and feel excited , so you become more self-confident , and it definitely affects your relationships with other people .
Unfortunately , you do n't have enough time to study because you spend time at the gym or on the pitch .
Another important aspect is that you will be the person who ensures a good team spirit , but when you are in a team , you may sometimes argue .
All in all , I still think that after-school sports clubs are a good idea .
In my class , most students say that sports are great .
Young and healthy people
Young people are less healthy now than they were twenty years ago , according to studies that appeared recently in newspapers .
One reason for this is that young people prefer playing video games to playing outdoors , because video games are more popular or , for example , because they are not used to playing football with their parents in the street .
Besides , young people eat too much junk food and are less willing to participate in sports that require more effort .
If I were a politician , I 'd encourage people to exercise outdoors , and I 'd build sports centres where people would n't have to pay .
In my opinion , junk food should be more expensive so that people will buy less .
When you start exercising , you soon feel better and ca n't stop .
Kaplan 's outside area .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to discuss how Kaplan College should spend a large sum of money to improve its outdoor area .
Build a garden
All Kaplan students know that behind Kaplan 's building there is an unused area the college could use to build a nice , beautiful garden .
This place does n't have facilities useful to everyone , so it would be great to invest in a garden that all students could use to relax in their free time .
Food and Drink
The college needs to invest in some nice , healthy restaurants around Kaplan because many students have been complaining about the food and drinks they have to buy on campus or in the surrounding area .
I heard a student say that around Kaplan there are only junk food restaurants .
They should eat at some nice , healthy , and inexpensive restaurants around Kaplan .
Recommendation
I recommend spending a lot of money to build a garden and several good restaurants around Kaplan College .
These improvements would increase the quality and behaviour of students ' work .
These would have a beneficial effect on all students .
Personally , I think people 's lives will change no matter what we do .
And there is nothing we can do about it .
But what we can do is decide whether that change will be for the best .
It sounds very easy and simple , but it is not .
We do n't make changes ; they are the result of the decisions we make and the consequences of our actions .
One of the biggest changes we see nowadays is how blind we humans are to everything that surrounds us .
We go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expenses and personal issues , so we do n't notice what surrounds us .
We do n't notice other people ; we do n't communicate with each other .
We 're lost in our minds , our cellphones , and our earphones .
This is a consequence of our misuse of technology , which could lead to another big change fifty years from now .
It 's like a vicious chain .
Fifty years from now , people wo n't know how to talk to each other .
We will lose our social skills .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to explain what the most important aspects of the environment in my city are .
BACKGROUND
Treviso is situated in northern Italy and was ruined during World War II .
Changes .
After being rapidly rebuilt and renovated , Treviso has become a modern city .
It is easily accessible by rail and air ; the population has increased thanks to industrial growth , and these factors have exacerbated environmental problems .
Developments
People interviewed at the front doors of the main public buildings , such as the town hall and schools , stated that they are , on average , happy with how the municipal authorities have dealt with problems arising from recent changes in the town , in particular regarding the following subjects :
Regarding air , light , and noise pollution , about 80 % of citizens said they are very satisfied with how these issues are being managed : cars are banned from the city centre , public lighting is powered by solar panels , and the mayor has signed an agreement with the builders ' union obliging them to create public parks in every area with 1,000 inhabitants .
Recycling : all families are provided with three bins for recycling , and at school children are taught about the subject from primary school .
Conclusion .
Treviso can offer a high standard of living , and people know that achieving this goal is a collective effort .
I would say a historical place in Sweden is the royal castle .
It 's in the capital of Sweden , Stockholm .
It 's big , beautiful , and has a lot of history .
The royal castle was rebuilt in 1697 after a fire .
It was n't in use until 1754 , and it was n't finished until 1770 .
Since then , not much has been rebuilt .
On the inside , there have been some changes and modernizations to suit the royal family , and on the outside there has been some painting of the façade .
Some museums have been added and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there , but it would be interesting to go sometime .
An invention of the 20th century that I feel has significantly changed people 's lives is the introduction of bank cash machines , or automatic teller machines .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenient access to money in emergencies or when money is needed .
It is also a convenience that helps save time , which is very important for working men and women in the late 1900s .
This machinery also permits you to do your banking when you wish , rather than during the assigned banking hours .
People may argue that ATMs will take away jobs at banks , but we must also focus on the positive aspects .
ATMs are found in all areas of the world .
In the United States , for example , you can find machines in stores , movie theatres , shopping-mall parking lots , and banks .
In many situations , I have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store .
This is when I really appreciate my ATM card .
Another advantage of the card is that it reduces the danger of having large quantities of cash in your home or wallet .
This entices robbers and can increase danger .
All in all , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . The convenience has proved itself in many circumstances , and I do not know what I would do without my card . The development of computerized technology has enhanced our environment , providing convenience and time-saving activities that reduce the stress of our everyday life .
The Amazon lava lizards are pretty hard to see .
When you saw one , it had probably already seen you .
I noticed in the field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juveniles , the immature males , and the females .
The adult males always seemed to be in the same place .
However , I ca n't confirm that they were the same males in the same places .
The smaller individuals tended to run away quickly when they noticed someone coming .
Also , they commonly return to the same place just after fleeing .
The lizards can remain motionless for a long time , making only a few movements , usually of the head .
The big ones showed more communicative displays , like head bobs and push-ups .
The boardwalk was the only place where I saw more than one animal that could interact with each other .
In other places , when there is more than one animal , they stay away from one another and do not interact .
The animals that use the boardwalk were more exposed than those at the other points .
The animals I observed in the vegetation were usually sheltered either by dense shrubs or by the spiny edges of bromeliad leaves .
The distance needed to cause these animals to flee was greater than that for the boardwalk lizards .
" I feel like I should tell her the truth and beg for her forgiveness , " Mark said to Michael .
Their friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few days , so she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
He agreed to it , but he did n't pay much attention to whether the doors of his house were properly shut , so the animal escaped .
" Jules is nowhere to be found , " he sighed .
I 'm just going to buy her a huge bouquet of flowers and hope she does n't take it too hard .
Michael , however , thought his friend was overreacting .
" I 'll fix this for him since he 's too stupid to fix it himself , " he thought .
He went into the first pet shop he found and bought a Siamese cat that he thought looked identical to the one entrusted to Mark .
Dear Jenny , I 'm sorry I 'm having Jules delivered to you , but I 'm busy and ca n't drop him off myself .
" Love , Mark , " he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
The next day there was a loud thumping at the door .
It was Mark , and he was furious .
Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it is n't her cat ?
And how dare you use my name on that card ?
Now , she does n't want to talk to me ever again !
" And I never want to talk to you again ! " he shouted as he quickly made his way off the porch .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A film I want to recommend to our student club is Captain America : The Winter Soldier ; it has a lot of adrenaline and emotion .
This film was released on March 13 and was a big success .
The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) is popular in the modern world , although it does not work well in areas where the signal is interfered with .
Consequently , indoor navigation with GPS is not very good .
This paper proposes an alternative to GPS for use in indoor environments .
The methods developed in this paper use only the positions of the Wireless Access Points ( WAPs ) and the signal strength ( RSSI ) recorded by the user to calculate the device 's position .
Since today 's computers and cellphones contain all the required hardware , future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost-effective .
One of the methods proposed in this paper typically gives the user a position that is off by about five meters .
Therefore , this method can not be used when a more precise estimate is needed .
However , a weighted average of these three methods and other similar methods might improve accuracy .
At the outset , it is worth considering what the phenomenon of shopping is .
Some people claim that going shopping gives them a lot of pleasure .
Recently I met a woman who maintained that spending money helps her calm down .
Yes .
In my family there are five people : my dad , my mum , my older sister , my younger brother , and me .
All of them always talk to me , share with me , and support me in everything .
They are not only my family members but also my best friends .
When I was a child , my dad or my mum usually took me to school on a motorbike , and I have fond memories of those times .
They bought me all the nice things that are useful for studying and made me interested in studying .
When I got a bad score , they did not blame me ; instead , they always said , " We count on you , " so I never felt scared or worried when I did something wrong , and that made me very confident .
I often told them my stories before I went to sleep , like how I made friends with a boy in my class , how I got over a dog on the road , etc .
After I grew up , I was n't very close to my parents ; I spent a lot of time doing outdoor activities with my siblings , such as exercising and traveling .
During that time , we overcame all our problems and came to understand each other better .
So now I am overseas , and I always think of my family as my best friends .
Hi , Hanna .
Last summer I worked at the cinema ; it was a very good experience for me , and I enjoyed it so much because I met a lot of people from different countries and cultures ; I worked there for about three months , and the pay was satisfactory ; at the cinema I learned the names of many films I had not heard of before ; my colleagues were very kind and friendly , and even after we finished our jobs we remain good friends and still spend time together , going out for drinks and sometimes for dinner .
I hope to do the same job next year because I love it and want to do it again .
In the future , public transport will no longer be necessary as owning a vehicle becomes very common .
The justifications behind this are :
1 . Advanced technology reduces the costs of manufacturing and maintaining automobiles to very affordable levels .
2 .
Recognizing that transportation is a necessity in daily life , governments will provide subsidies to residents who can not afford to own a car .
Under the future social welfare scheme , a person whose annual income is below a specified threshold will be provided with a car free of charge , and all related maintenance costs , such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and servicing , will be reimbursed by the government .
3 . There is no need to get a driving licence to operate a car .
With the assistance of advanced GPS technology , we can simply speak our destination , and the car will automatically take us there with ease .
When will the day of " no public transport " come ?
We can not tell at this moment , but one thing is for sure : technology keeps changing our lives and ways of living .
My city 's airport is not very far from my home , but at the same time it is not easy to reach .
The most comfortable way is to travel by private car , which allows you to take the highway and then head toward the city centre .
My home is close to the central railway station and the most important bus stops in the metropolitan area .
As a second option , there is a railway service from the airport to a secondary railway station .
Here I have to get off and then take bus number 25 , which will take me to the city centre , from where I can walk home .
Another option is to use a taxi service , but in this case the cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
The two best choices for getting home from the airport are a private car or the airport rail service , which is very cheap ; I spend a bit more time and money , but the journey is pleasant and comfortable , much like the trip by private car .
I am a tall , blonde girl who loves all sports , but my favorite is basketball .
I enjoy this sport because it is very dynamic , teaches me many things such as being polite and responsible , and , above all , it is a group game—I love working as a team .
One piece of advice for anyone starting this sport is to always work as a team : do n't just think of yourself , think of what 's best for the team .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door , I was surprised to see that my brother 's foot was covered in blood .
I was really upset .
He came in , and I helped him .
I told him he had to go to the hospital to have his foot treated , but he did n't listen .
He was afraid that if he went to the hospital , our parents would find out about this .
I asked him how this happened , and he told me that he had fallen off his motorcycle .
That 's when I realised what was going on .
He did n't want our parents to know because his godfather had just bought him the motorcycle and our mother was against it ; he kept it only on the condition that he would be really careful .
I told him that we had to go to the hospital even if that meant our parents were going to take his motorcycle away .
He understood that he had no choice , so he agreed .
I called my mum and told her everything that happened .
She came to our house and took my brother to the hospital .
I was really worried , but hopefully everything was all right .
The pie chart depicts the proportions of fuel types used to generate energy in Florida in 2007 , compared with the forecast for 2017 .
Overall , it is clear that natural gas is the main energy source in both years , while renewables and oil are at the bottom of the list .
For example , the energy generated by natural gas increased from 38.8 % in 2007 to 54.4 % in 2017 .
Next comes energy production from coal , which accounted for 29.3 % of the energy market in 2007 , followed by a projected drop of 5.6 % in 2017 .
As for nuclear , although it is the third-largest energy generator in Florida in both years compared , the trend is upward , reaching 15.9 % in the estimated period .
In contrast , energy production from both oil and other sources falls significantly between the two years , from 6.7 % to 1.1 % for oil and from 11.1 % to 3.4 % for other sources .
As for renewables , the decrease in fuel generation over the period is less dramatic .
There are some reasons , according to the text , that explain how Venus shines so brightly .
In addition to these reasons , the passage contains information about Venus 's temperature , and the listening passage may contradict some information expressed in the text .
Some questions are asked during the listening to expand on the information about this planet .
How can Venus be so hot if it is covered by thick white clouds ? It should be cold , should n't it ?
There is another question about this high temperature : a planet closer to the Sun is hotter than Venus , so Venus is n't hot because of its proximity to the Sun .
The most amazing question is : How can it be hot in a place where sulfuric acid prevents the sun from entering ?
The listening passage could link to the information in the text , stimulate questions , and provide answers to make the reader more curious about the topic .
There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK .
The most talked-about issues concerning roads are probably congestion and safety .
Congestion is most apparent around the major conurbations such as London , Greater Manchester , and Birmingham .
A simple way to solve this problem would be either to build more roads or to widen the existing ones .
However , this , as seen in recent events such as Newbury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .
Another way to reduce congestion , especially in large cities , could be to persuade people not to use their vehicles at all .
Introducing measures such as park-and-ride schemes and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
Safety is often cited as a priority for roads .
Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads .
There are several ways to combat this problem .
Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased , lowering it by several units would deter many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport .
Increasing law enforcement could also be effective , giving the police greater authority to make arrests , increasing the number of speed cameras , and possibly imposing larger fines .
Reducing the national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
The condition of roads is often a local issue rather than a national concern .
It is therefore up to the local council to maintain its roads better , especially in winter .
This may require the local council to obtain more money from the government .
Safety is much less of a factor for rail transport .
Here , the major talking point is efficiency .
It is often noted that trains are delayed and rarely run on time .
Because of this inefficiency , many rail customers are turning to other forms of transport , mainly cars , but for long-distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option .
Much of the blame for this inefficiency lies with the trains themselves , which in most cases are outdated and slower than modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese bullet train .
The train tracks can also be blamed , as they are often in a state of disrepair , which inevitably delays trains .
It is hoped that the recent privatisation of British Rail will introduce more up-to-date trains and increase the overall efficiency of train travel , in a bid to attract many more customers .
In the reading passage , the author thought that technology helps us live more comfortably .
The author gave an example : first , we do n't have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone discovered how to use fire ; second , we do n't have to live in caves anymore .
However , the professor disagrees with the author .
She thinks technology does n't always make us better ; on the contrary , it often makes us worse .
She said technology has led to weak relationships with family and friends .
And it even makes our situation worse because it causes a lot of pollution .
Finally , the professor suggests that we reduce our use of technology .
If we use it less , we will have a better relationship and a better environment .
Apparently , the author did n't notice the bad influence of technology .
In this essay , I will put forward and briefly break down the controversy involving problems related to zoos .
As a controversial topic , it attracts arguments both for and against .
Depending on the point of view each person might take , the argument they give may differ .
It is very likely that animals in zoos suffer from not being in their natural habitat , being stared at almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably , and lacking the natural peace they need to live .
Furthermore , it is important not only to say that these animals live in groups , but also to note that in zoos only a few are kept .
Nevertheless , it is very useful for society , and especially for children , to have the opportunity to visit a zoo .
If it were not for zoos , it would be practically impossible for the majority of the population to know about wild animals .
This experience provides a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for adults , such as veterinarians , scientists , and even anthropologists .
All in all , it would be difficult to find a fair solution , or even to provide one that addresses both opposing sides of the issue .
I reckon safari parks would be a compromise between these opposing sides ; they would provide a better quality of life for animals and would also be educational .
Firstly , what is the European Union ?
It seems to have two distinct forms , the one that worries the British public most being political union , followed by economic and monetary union .
In fact , these issues have become so heated in Great Britain that they have led to many disputes within the current government .
They also appear to be major reasons for Mrs. Thatcher 's resignation .
By losing her , have we not already lost part of our sovereignty ?
Europe is forcing change upon us while we have been attempting to stand back— " not letting socialism in by the back door " —instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision-making processes in the European Community .
Great Britain can not afford to play a minor role in a two-speed Europe , especially during the current recession , and this has been reflected in top-level governmental disputes .
So , a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable , whether we like it or not .
On monetary and economic union , I do n't feel that we have much to lose ; on the contrary , I think we would benefit enormously , especially in the light of 1992 .
If only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I 'm sure the British public would agree .
After all , how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international stock exchanges in New York , Tokyo , and Frankfurt ?
Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much of a difference ?
Did n't the " Big Bang " in October 1987 send shock waves worldwide , with share prices plummeting ?
World processes are becoming increasingly interlinked , and their effects often know no physical borders .
I therefore see this European unity as a natural process in the development of the world , something that should be facilitated rather than hindered .
Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ?
The issue of political union is still more disputed .
Yes , we have a Queen , and what would happen to her — would she be forced to abdicate and be succeeded by King Jacques Delors ?
This is a very typical , misinformed , and ignorant statement made by certain British " patriots " .
There are five other monarchs in the European Community , and their status will not be greatly affected by any such union .
But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels ' bureaucracy , which rightly worries the British public .
This situation must be changed to end the Council 's secrecy and to transfer greater powers to the European Parliament , creating a more democratic system .
This will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on—something which must be guaranteed for such independent thinkers as the Britons themselves .
An answer to Britain 's reservation about European unity , which I find most plausible at present , is a federal union that would ensure decisions , where possible , are taken at local levels .
This , if properly carried out , would enable us to keep our cultural identity , the ultimate element of our sovereignty .
Dementia is a common disease among the elderly .
It is difficult for humans to cure them , so robots are used to help .
In this case , research at this monument reported that :
Social commitment robots are designed to promote therapeutic interactions .
Communication and social interaction .
The therapeutic use of the robots is being attempted .
They reach out to people affected by dementia and may provide an alternative mode of support .
Engagement with this population .
( Mordoch et al. , 2013 , p. 15 )
Consequently , these robots benefit patients who have difficulty with personal interactions , enabling them to feel pleasure and relaxation .
In Japan , people are especially keen to use robots to care for the aging population because homes and hospitals often do not allow animal-assisted therapy .
Unlike in Japan , people in North America prefer animal-assisted therapy , and robotics are used less frequently than animals .
I 've been a member of the Active Leisure Club since 7 April 2013 and I 'm really pleased with your letter because it means that you care about your customers .
What I really appreciate is the staff 's qualifications , particularly those of the fitness instructors , and their punctuality .
This aspect is really important for working people .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness of the premises : everything is always perfect ; I often see the showers being sanitized , and people respect all the common areas .
I also have some suggestions .
It would be really useful to have some hairdryers in the locker rooms ; that way people could enjoy a complete service and arrive home relaxed or ready to go out .
Another service that could make you more competitive with other centres is a massage room ; after any sporting activity , it would be nice to have a personal masseur to take care of your tired body .
Anyway , I 'm really glad to have a leisure club in my city that helps me keep fit !
Thank you for your interest .
To Whom It May Concern :
Mary James
Mary James and I met at Marianista School .
We went to secondary school together and have been friends for five years , so we know each other very well .
When Mary was in secondary school , she proved herself to be a brilliant student .
She was not only competent but also hard-working , and that was reflected in her high grades .
She was not boastful ; instead , she helped other students who had difficulty with their subjects .
She was appreciated by students and teachers for her kindness and willingness to help .
Mary is extremely loyal to her friends .
She is also caring and supportive , and she knows exactly what to say when you are going through a tough situation .
Moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , and whenever she sets an objective she accomplishes it .
When Mary was a student , she was very demanding of herself and wanted to do everything perfectly ; as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
However , as the years went by , she managed to handle those situations as she learned how to organize and complete her tasks more efficiently .
Mary has always been interested in British culture , and therefore she has studied English for several years and has read many books about Great Britain .
Having finished high school , she intends to pursue a career and is looking for an opportunity that will enable her to achieve her goal and develop her English-speaking skills .
It is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would undoubtedly suit her , and I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Yours faithfully ,

Would you like to find the best place for our last dinner ?
First , we must look for a restaurant that offers group specials , since we are a large group .
If we go to a normal restaurant , we will dislike the treatment .
I am sure there are some restaurants we could go to .
I am going to explain what my favourite is for this special occasion .
I suggest 'Pomodoro ' .
This Italian restaurant is located in the city centre .
Both characteristics are most important to me .
First of all , most people like this kind of food , such as pizza or macaroni .
Also , the location is perfect because we can arrive easily on foot or by bus .
After dinner , we may go to some discos or pubs .
Besides , this restaurant has delightful decor .
It seems you are sitting in a Roman theatre .
The waiters are from Italy , so they may speak to us in Italian , which would be very useful for practising this language .
In conclusion , I would recommend this restaurant .
It is the ideal place for us — a big place with delicious food and , of course , a great location .
Nowadays , film stars , musicians , politicians , and models live in the limelight .
Some of them want it , and some are less enthusiastic about being the center of attention .
Journalists often follow them .
In my opinion , celebrities have a right to privacy , as long as they do n't tell everything about themselves in the tabloids .
First of all , everyone has a right to privacy .
Being a famous artist or politician is an unusual job , but it 's still only a job , and after work everyone wants to have their own life .
On the other hand , being a superstar makes it almost impossible to have a private life .
Well-known people are frequently in touch with their fans , and the public knows them very well .
In my view , everyone has a right to privacy without exceptions .
Journalists who follow celebrities just cross the line .
The paparazzi often violate people 's privacy .
We do n't have to know everything about them ; for example , the condition of an actress 's hair when she was shopping .
Superstars also deserve to have their own lives ; no one deserves to be followed or spied on .
Colombia 's army is a good model for other armies in Latin America and even for armies around the world .
Even so , many Colombians do not know that their soldiers ' day-to-day hard work is done for the sole purpose of protecting our lives and guaranteeing democracy for all of us .
Therefore , it is necessary to know why the Colombian army has this distinction .
First , Colombia 's military has 438,700 personnel , making it the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil .
The Colombian army is regarded as one of the best in the world due to its internal conflict , which keeps its soldiers active and in constant training ; Colombia is even training armies from other Latin American countries as well as from Africa and the Middle East because of the forty-year anti-terrorist campaign its armed forces have waged , during which they have been masterfully strengthened by preparation , intelligence , and modern tactical resources .
Second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in the fight against terrorism , such as foiling terrorist attacks , neutralizing explosive devices left in urban and rural areas , preventing the recruitment of children , organizing medical brigades to help farmers , and , most importantly , sacrificing their lives if necessary to protect each and every one of us , even those they do not know .
Finally , I can say that the hard work and the good image of the Colombian army simply reflect our wish to live in peace .
Likewise , all Colombians want to achieve their dreams peacefully , without weapons or fighting among themselves , and thus show the world that they are brave enough to fight for peace .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Sorry , I did n't answer your letter earlier .
I was really busy organizing the next concert .
By the way , your VIP tickets are in the drawer of my desk .
As you asked , I 'll write something about helping with Kokon 's concert , which took place last month .
It was a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything .
At the beginning , I had a problem with the owner of the pub .
He was n't convinced that we 'd be able to sell as many tickets to pay for the pub .
He did n't know the band and was really sceptical about it .
But you know , where there 's a will , there 's a way , and at last I won him over .
When he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see how things were working , he was just speechless with surprise .
His pub was full of people as it had never been before .
I never told him that , though Kokon is quite an underground band ; it has so many fans !
His facial expression almost killed me when I saw it .
It was a mix of outrage at the crowd in his pub and happiness at the money they spent on beer .
And how about the concert ?
It was incredible .
Although I had to take care of everything , I could have a great time too .
We are planning upcoming events with the leader of Kokon .
I 'll let you know about concerts coming up this month .
Just tell me when you are going to come back to Bytom .
Kisses ,
Wydra
She started her life with many problems , and after each period of sadness she discovers that she has the ability to continue .
From her perspective , the hardest part of losing someone is that , no matter how many people she has lost in different circumstances , she never gets used to the feeling and each time it hurts as much as the first .
She travels and attempts to leave behind everything that causes her sadness ; she tries to keep away from politics and to rid her mind of images of the military and weapons , but human bloodshed continues to haunt her .
She was writing about each important event .
I think that nowadays most people use public transport less .
I understand that cars are more comfortable and safer for travel and for short trips ; however , they are more harmful to the environment .
People in some countries use different forms of transport , for example bikes or trains , to get around the city .
Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes .
Genetic engineering is , however , a very controversial issue , and there is a lot of resistance to this work , especially to suggestions of using it on humans .
The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study , and indeed he may , there is still so much that we do not know about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
Indeed , this fear is justified .
When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust , I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered .
But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no idea it would be used as a weapon ?
We can argue that the scientist must have the greatest understanding of the discovery 's uses , good or bad , since he is the expert on the subject .
But are we right to blame him ?
Let us suppose that , as a result of genetic engineering , he has discovered a cure for cancer .
It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask whether I should introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100 % sure of the consequences .
Can we expect a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world ?
In truth , no—it is unreasonable .
Genetic engineering is developing rapidly and has already been used extensively in plants and bacteria , notably to produce resistant plant strains and human insulin .
The natural next step is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders such as Down syndrome .
There is a lot of resistance to this , and fear that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones .
Some of these may seem a little far-fetched , but it is conceivable that in 100 years ' time we may be able to decide our child 's characteristics , whether he will be a great pianist or a sportsman .
It does not seem morally right to make these decisions , and , to anyone religious , it would certainly be seen as interfering with God 's ways and therefore something to be avoided at all costs .
A great scientist can not see into the future .
He can not gauge the moral repercussions of his discovery , nor the long-term effects it will have on the world .
If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause , who are we to criticise him when we know far less about it ?
Provided that a scientist 's work has been permitted and is public , I feel it is unjust to hold him responsible for what the world will make of his work .
To avoid continually writing " he/she " or " his/her " , the scientist in this essay has been referred to as " he " .
I hope no offence is taken at this .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing in response to the invitation to share my experience of making a difficult decision , which appeared in the July issue of your English-language magazine .
As a nineteen-year-old student , I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of study to pursue .
First of all , I strongly believe that making choices is always risky , because people do not know what the exact outcome will be .
Like most adolescents , I was at a total loss when it came time to decide what I wanted to be in the future .
In despair , I applied for two courses of study that did not resemble one another at all , which made choosing much harder .
Knowing that this choice was not only a fundamental decision but would also influence the rest of my adult life , I appealed for help in deciding what I should focus on when making my decision .
As time passed , I attended more and more classes .
I could not cope with such a busy timetable ; consequently , I was exhausted and stressed .
A decision had to be made before I dropped out of both courses of study .
I kept the advice I was given in mind and chose what made me happy , despite not having the approval of some of my relatives .
I am convinced that stark choices are unavoidable , but to avoid regretting the consequences they may have , whether positive or negative , people should choose what makes them happier .
However , I have not taken for granted that my decision will not make me regret it .
If this were the case , I know that I am always on time to start again .
For the above-mentioned reasons , I think choices must be carefully considered before they are made .
Even though this does not guarantee the results .
I look forward to reading subsequent articles on related issues .
Yours faithfully ,
Vilma Rossi
There are many standards by which success and hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past .
In earlier times , people fended for themselves .
They were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present society .
Because of the differences in personalities and ambitions , I feel that in today 's society men and women should be financially rewarded for their individual efforts .
In a society , each person has the same basic needs for survival .
Long ago , the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up the majority of each person 's day .
In order to feed your family , you had to plant crops .
In order to live , you had to build .
To have clothes , you had to sew them .
Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs .
Even in early times , the harder you worked , the more food , shelter , and clothing you gained .
This is a very simple example of reward equaling effort .
Bringing this to the present , we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology , expanding knowledge , and modern conveniences .
It would appear that we have many machines to help us meet our food , clothing , and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part .
People with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone else to do the work .
However , just as in earlier days , the harder you work , the greater the reward .
Let 's imagine a society where all men and women are treated equally .
All basic survival needs ( and even wants , for that matter ) were provided regardless of the effort put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced a society as we are today .
Competitiveness and jealousy would set in , and fights would occur .
In the worst-case scenario , the world could become divided or even be destroyed because someone sat on the sidelines and did n't do their part .
We would not have the motivation to develop our talents and abilities or to use them in ways that benefit others .
Our society would become selfish and greedy , and our culture would suffer .
It may be a pessimistic view , but I feel it 's a very real one to say that we would become lazy and stagnant people .
Life is about rewards .
It is about learning where you are and how you can move yourself to the next level .
Each of us is measured daily against some standard of achievement .
Effort is vital to success ; motivation is the key to effort .
Some are content with their needs ; others want more , much more !
Our system of rewards is money ... but is it really about money ?
I do n't think so .
It 's about meeting needs ( and even wants ! ) and how much one is willing to give up for the opportunity to have something better .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name is Ciprina Pires and I am 17 years old .
I 'm writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a job at a summer camp in the USA and would like to apply .
I like to work with children between 8 and 12 years old because they are full of energy and will understand many of the activities we give them .
Normally , I like to organise activities for others that are interesting and different .
I love organising evening activities more than other activities because they make me more excited and enthusiastic .
Now , I have been cooking for my family , and I love it . I would love to cook for 100 people .
I can speak English well enough that everyone can understand me . I 'm energetic , hardworking , and cheerful .
................
Yours sincerely ,
Ciprina
The impact on modern biology was enormous , and for this reason the inventor was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 .
For this invention , Mullis received a $ 10,000 bonus from his employer , but in a short time the rights to use the process earned the company $ 300 million .
Watching television is , for many people , the main way to spend their free time .
Children spend more than an hour a day watching television .
Parents are worried about what their children watch because they think their children do n't learn anything from it ; it only entertains them .
It is far from real .
If we choose the correct programs , they could inadvertently teach us a lot .
There are many documentaries about the environment , animals , and the human body that are very interesting and entertaining .
Cartoons can be translated into English or other languages to improve them .
The TV can be used to leave one 's mind blank or fill it with a lot of useful knowledge .
Now the stone is on their roof .
Plastic bags are banned in the city .
The town council is planting more trees .
Solar heaters have been installed in houses instead of water heaters .
Install a rainwater storage system to increase the water level .
Human waste is properly handled by the town council .
The government is encouraging people to use public transport instead of cars .
Using a bicycle is more environmentally friendly .
LED lights were introduced to reduce electricity usage .
Change is always good .
It is widely accepted that change is an essential driver of progress .
In fact , for many people , without change , humanity would still live as in prehistoric times , without fire , wheels , or even comfortable houses . We would live in caves , would n't we ?
We would only eat what our men hunted .
We would wear animal leather .
Oh !
What a ridiculous drawing !
But in my opinion , the problem is more complex .
Conservative people , for instance , are usually reluctant to change because , in general , they fear uncertainty and prefer bad but certain things to uncertain ones .
In addition , if you glance at history , although revolutionary times are usually traumatic , humanity tends to improve afterward .
The question is whether the convulsions , violence , and wars that often accompany change are really worth it ?
It is often said that public transport is bound to disappear , since most people seem to prefer using their own cars for nearly every journey they make .
This is probably true for most people .
Sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer travelling by car to using public transport . Travelling by car offers many advantages .
For instance , you can decide exactly the time you want to leave and the place you want to leave from .
You do not have to share your journey with anyone if you do not want to , and you can get to the exact point where you want to be .
Everything about cars seems advantageous .
So , why does public transport still exist ?
To begin with , not everybody can own a car .
But even if everybody could , it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big city such as Barcelona by car .
I do not think there would be enough space for so many vehicles , either to park or to drive on the road .
Moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anybody could survive it .
The future
The problems at this plant are increasing every day , and people ask themselves , " What will the future be like in 30 years ? "
We think that the world will be destroyed .
Initially , many plant species will have become extinct , and 90 percent of fauna will be endangered .
After that , food will become insufficient to meet society 's needs , and people will die of starvation . Diseases will become more common , and many people will die from epidemics .
An appreciable proportion of the population will have been diagnosed with cancer .
Living in an egalitarian society , people will collaborate to save the world ; we will use robots to clean the planet , scientists will design special clothes to protect against radiation , and people will use oxygen tanks .
We live in a society divided by social status .
Poor people will live in the trash , while rich people will live in spacecraft .
There will be wars over water .
Once you become famous , you will know the taste and the price of fame .
There are many people in my country who think that being famous is , to some extent , a blessing .
Such a person is known to most people nationally or even internationally .
Some believe there are many advantages to being a celebrity or well-known person , though there are also a number of disadvantages .
First of all , many local and world-famous celebrities claim to have no private life .
Being famous probably means that , for most of your life , journalists , your neighbours , and ordinary people will be interested in you .
Most of the time , it is impossible to avoid this kind of attention .
People are curious and admire the lives of their favourite stars by reading magazines , watching TV , or surfing the Internet .
Moreover , such yellow-press columns titled 'Celebrities ' broke sales records , bringing huge benefits to publishing companies .
Millions of people can buy magazines featuring celebrities on the cover , although some photos reveal additional and not very pleasant details .
People are interested in almost everything : articles about breakups , drug-abusing young celebrities , questionable relationships , or even those featuring naked photos of celebrities .
This is more than sharing some details of your private life : most members of the press look for scandals and aim to uncover the most intimate secrets .
Secondly , being successful and famous also requires a person to be good at their job .
The 'star ' is not only followed by the public but is also evaluated by producers and prospective employers .
There is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , more desirable jobs , and lucrative salaries .
The majority of celebrities have personal managers who take care of their image .
So even if you are rich and famous , that does not always mean you can live and act as you would like .
Fame has another side : strict requirements for actors , singers , and others that take effect when they sign contracts with the companies that employ them .
Attending some events or parties may be a necessity and does not always depend on a celebrity 's wishes .
Also , it is said that fame spoils people and they struggle with their personal problems ; it is even more difficult to help them than it is to help ordinary people .
Sometimes there are cases when the lack of privacy leads to more serious issues .
We all know that some well-known people become involved in illegal activities , start using drugs or alcohol , and even join mysterious religious groups .
Sometimes they even become suicidal just because they can not live under constant pressure .
Even though being in the public eye is not always pleasant , there are a number of advantages that make it worth sacrificing a little of your private life .
Going deep into the world of public entertainment , which is definitely rewarding , gives you many benefits .
Most celebrities do not work their entire lives , although the money they earn during their careers ( sometimes only a very short period of success ) allows them to live without any worries .
Revealing some personal details about your life while you 're famous may bring you fortune .
For example , many celebrities sell photos of their newborns to magazines , which offer enormous sums of money , allowing the public a tiny glimpse into their family life .
Moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence other people , especially younger generations .
By setting a good example , celebrities may become idols and inspire others to live and help those who are in need .
Donating money to charities and being involved in volunteer projects are some of the things you can do when you are wealthy and famous .
To summarise , fame has many disadvantages as well as a number of advantages .
Celebrities have different experiences .
Their lives seem glamorous and they look gorgeous , though you can never know what lies beneath that beautiful , sparkling cover .
Shopping Online
Currently , with the internet having penetrated our lives , online shopping is very popular , especially among young people .
Although some refuse to shop online because the Internet is virtual , I am unhesitatingly hooked on it .
First of all , we enjoy greater convenience and save time by shopping online .
For example , time and space need not be taken into account when we shop online .
Since we want to purchase something , we can shop online .
As is well-known , there is no shutdown at online stores .
In addition , walking long distances could be avoided if we shop online .
Once we place an order , the merchant will dispatch the goods immediately .
Meanwhile , it 's easier to buy quality , inexpensive goods online .
Thanks to displays of customer feedback and merchants ' reputations on the website , we can directly evaluate and , to some extent , select items from the vast range of products available online that interest us .
Finally , online shopping plays an essential role in our lives because of its convenience and flexibility .
In other words , shopping online really perfects our lives .
I believe it will be more wholesome and guaranteed through optimization of the network market .
Dear USA Summer Camp ,
I want this job because I like children and being outdoors , and I am willing to work a lot at night if necessary .
I am very good at organizing activities suitable for children . Last year I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children and how to work with them .
Last year I attended cooking lessons , where I learned how to prepare food suitable for children and how to make desserts for both adults and children .
I 'm a nice , funny , and sociable person who is good with children .
At the moment , people use public transport , but many are starting to travel much more in their own cars instead of using it , which , in my opinion , is better .
One reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , or other public transport we can fit more people than in a car or on a motorcycle , so we pollute less because we use one vehicle instead of each person using a car or motorcycle , which would pollute much more . As always , things have a price , but we must ask : is it worth paying to save our ecosystem , or even our lives ?
I think so , and besides , it is much cheaper than buying a car and having to refuel it every month or less ; another reason I prefer to use public transport is that I have to follow a schedule so I wo n't be late for the places I want to go , and bus stops even have codes that show how long it will be until the next bus .
To conclude , public transport is much better than using a car or a motorbike , but people do n't realize it .
Terrorism is the use of fear and violent acts to intimidate societies or governments .
Many different types of social or political organizations might use terrorism to try to achieve their goals .
It is difficult to define terrorism .
There is no official criminal-law definition of terrorism at the international level .
Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts that are intended to create fear ( terror ) , are carried out for religious , political , or ideological goals , and target civilians .
Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and acts of war .
The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism , though the same actions may be called terrorism when carried out by a politically motivated group .
Best friends are meant to last forever .
In that sense , family will always be there for us .
But what if they are not that close to you ?
What if they always keep you pampered ?
Of course you will feel irritated , especially during your teenage years .
Family protects us and cares for us , but it will be irritating if they continue to do the same when you grow up .
They should give you some space .
When you are a child , you love being with your parents and enjoy hanging out with them . Once you grow up , you shift that focus to friends and consider them your everything , but remember that only family will be there for you in the worst times .
I think they 've changed , since there are more and more overweight children by the day .
Portugal is one of the European countries with the most overweight children , with a slightly higher number than Spain and Ireland .
Eastern European countries have fewer overweight children ; could this be an influence of former communist rule ?
When you have nothing to eat , you do n't become overweight and , consequently , do n't develop conditions that are common among overweight people , such as diabetes .
That 's the only upside of communism over capitalism , albeit unintended .
Although it would be amusing for me to continue to slag off communism , let 's not go there .
The topic is eating habits , which are always eradicated , along with health and prosperity , when communists take power in countries .
Bang !
Nowadays , in my country , people eat many of the same unhealthy foods as people in other Western countries .
We used to eat a lot of codfish , the stereotypical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , and that 's part of the reason we have so many fat kids .
When I was a kid fifteen years ago , kids used to be slim .
When I entered first grade , there was n't a single fat kid in the class .
Today , 32 % of children are overweight .
In just twenty years , we became one of the European countries with the highest rates of childhood obesity .
So yes , eating habits have changed dramatically in my country , but we may get our good old slim silhouettes back after our new government , probably a coalition of socialists and communists , takes office .
Food : everybody loves it . Some people hate it too—those who ca n't control themselves and suffer the health consequences of overeating .
Lack of self-control is a very sad thing .
Fortunately , I do n't have that problem .
I lack the inspiration to write , but I 'll try because I have to .
Eating habits in my country .
I 've already talked about the fat kids who eat things that make them fat .
Shitty food is trendy in my country , as I said , but that 's true of every European country , as I also said .
But I guess it 's better than eating roots and animal corpses , as our hominid ancestors did millions of years ago .
Hunter-gatherers thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n't have to eat rotting flesh because they hunted animals—like the first half of their name suggests . I know I really look like an idiot for writing things like this , but that only proves I was telling the truth when I said I was lacking inspiration .
I 've been reading Milton 's Paradise Lost first because I want to read it for its literary significance and second because I want to improve my English ; reading it is a good way to achieve that goal .
I 'm only in the first book .
It 's an excellent work , of course .
I thought I would have trouble comprehending Milton 's English because , you know , it 's not the English you hear from the average contemporary English speaker , but it turns out it 's a much easier read than I thought .
I find Shakespeare harder ; with a bit of effort I can understand it , though not always—at least for now .
Dear 230-year-old me , I am only 15 now ; I have n't lived long enough .
I am just a kid ; I am not yet complete and have a lot to discover and shape in my life .
I have no idea how I am going to get there . I am now in my bed studying for my tests tomorrow , but I guess 215 years from now it wo n't matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long . Are n't you bored of living ?
Do you ever wish you were dead ?
I bet you have the God complex ; you must feel powerful .
But do you ?
Or perhaps you feel weak , vulnerable , dead inside , and lost ... You have lived far longer than anyone should .
Of course , living like this must have consequences . What is it like in your head ?
What do you look like ?
What do you think of yourself ?
Are you happy about what you have become ?
What have you done ?
What is the price of being you ?
Did you really give up everything to have what you have ?
Do you ever regret it ?
Do you feel lonely ?
What are you doing with your cold heart ?
Is there anything that can unfreeze it ?
I dreamt of you , you know ?
We were in a forest ; the sun was high in the sky , the birds were singing , and I could hear the sound of water falling ; it was a heavenly , beautiful place , and then you were there behind a tree ; you did n't say a word , but we moved closer , looking into each other 's eyes , and then I put my right hand on your cheek , and in that moment I felt you—your skin , your soul , your existence .
It lasted for a few moments ; it was magical .
I guess we are going to meet only in one place : Heaven ; we are not supposed to know each other on Earth .
It does n't matter in our miserable mortal lives anyway .
I felt you in that dream , and I would not change it for anything .
I felt close to you .
Somehow , without even meeting you , I fell in love with your existence .
And it kills me tonight that I will always have love in my heart for you , forever .
I will weep for you , my love , day and night ; even when my eyes wo n't let my tears fall , my heart will always weep .
Reckless , pretty , and wild .
I hated that the teacher was Clara .
She taught history in 2º E.S.O . She has short curly brown hair .
She always had a ponytail .
Clara was serious and bossy .
She generally shouted at everyone when she taught a lesson .
Clara was worse than Pilar , my English teacher .
Pilar was kind and fantastic with children .
The " Valle del Ambroz " school is a small place .
It 's a small building located in the centre of the village .
Classes are small , and the pavilion is too .
The quality of the teachers was good , although they explained very poorly because the students were not well informed .
I sometimes hated them because they did n't see the effort we put into preparing for exams , even though we were so psyched about them .
The other reason I hated it was that they gave difficult exams and were also demanding .
However , I have a great memory , and all my teachers say it helps me pull it off .
I still dream of having a chance to travel around the world . There are many ways to get from one place to another , but I prefer to travel by boat or train because on a boat or train I can feel the wind on my face or hand and hear the birds above me . On a plane you can see only the blue sky and nothing more ; it feels strange to me to be between the earth and the sky , so I prefer traveling by boat or train .
Not only does public transport have a future , but it also deserves a bright one .
Despite the fact that travelling by car may be more comfortable , we should all be fully aware that public transport ought to occupy a prime place in our future mobility .
Otherwise , the Earth 's future might be put at risk .
Indeed , if we , as a civilised society , were aware of the problem of greenhouse gases being repeatedly emitted into the atmosphere , we would use public transport much more often .
In this way , air pollution would be reduced as a result of using buses , trains , or the underground , all of which are public modes of transport that can reduce the large number of private cars on our streets and roads .
In addition to cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , reducing the number of cars would improve the safety of our roads , as there would be fewer vehicles circulating throughout the country .
Both effects would combine to offer a healthier environment in which our children could grow up safely .
On top of that , there is no excuse not to use public transport , as it has improved remarkably over the last few years .
Nowadays it is almost possible to reach any place at any time by public transport , thereby eliminating one of the main problems it used to pose for potential users .
So if we are determined to preserve our beloved planet and make it a better place to live , a good start would be to leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
The last film I saw was not new ; in fact , it was " The Others . " It is the best horror and suspense film that I have ever seen in my life .
It is set on a small English island in 1946 , when the Second World War ended .
A crazy woman is waiting for her husband .
She has a duty to protect her children because they are allergic to light .
Recently , three new servants appeared in the mansion : Bertha Mills , Mr. Tuttle , and Lydia .
Strange things happen in the mansion .
At first , the little girl Anne ( daughter of Grace ) hears and sees these strange things , but her mother and brother Nicholas do n't believe her .
Anne constantly told her mother about the strange things she saw , and Nicholas did too .
As time passed , everyone in the house began to feel these strange things .
At this moment , Charles ( the husband and father ) returns to the house , but one day he disappears again .
One day all the curtains in the house disappeared , and this was serious because the children were sick and could n't receive sunlight .
I would recommend this film to anyone because the story seems real .
The movie has excellent sound effects and evokes epic sensations .
As we discussed before the project was launched , the two-domain structure causes problems and inconvenience in both management and maintenance and in collecting analytics ( Google , etc . ) .
Thus , using a single-domain structure seems preferable if the site can be developed that way using WordPress CMS combined with custom code .
Now it 's time to draw the line on all the considerations and make the final decision ( with SCHEME included ) .
To ensure recognition among members of the same species , the movements of the procession are specific to each , and the female selects the one that suits her best .
Both mates performed movements to display submissive behavior and copulate .
Before I begin this rather obvious presentation , I would like to state my opinion : a well-organized , well-scheduled , and extensively routed transport system is one possible way to get around the city .
So , the advantages of a personal car are : you do n't have to deal with strangers , and you 're in control of your route .
Avoid wasting time on multiple stops and reach your destination ( your workplace , a shop , or even a suburban ski club ) much more easily and quickly .
And the above arguments are against owning a car : it is expensive , not ecological , and you have to take care of it ( parking , repairs , insurance , cleaning ) and raise a lot of money to buy one .
Thus , the main question is : flexibility or price .
As soon as the problem of the cost of owning a car is resolved , the question of the necessity of public transport will be raised again .
Many people believe that public transport has no future due to an enormous increase in sales of new modes of transport , such as electric cars and bicycles .
For this reason , people wonder whether conventional means of transport could disappear because of this new transport trend .
In my opinion , public transport is the best option for getting around the city for several reasons .
First of all , given the financial crisis , public transport , such as buses or the underground , is the cheapest way to travel or even get around in your city .
Overall , when you add not only the petrol price but also maintenance , services , insurance , and a few expensive taxes , the total cost is much higher .
In addition , everybody knows that a bus carries more people than a car ; consequently , it produces less pollution .
By contrast , it is true that many places do not have good transport links and can take quite a long time to get to .
Imagine if everyone had a car ; nobody would be able to get to work on time .
On balance , public transport is the best option for getting around the city .
But maybe , if communication between villages and bus timetables improves , public transport could be even better .
Since we had a lot of success with this invention , I started to have some fantasies about other high-tech portable inventions I could create .
I started imagining some kind of synthetic textile or fiber that , when water touches its surface , does n't get wet .
This could be really useful for the military because sometimes they have to work in the rain , and their hands and bodies get wet , which is uncomfortable .
To do this , I had to change how the water behaves when it touches the surface so that , instead of being absorbed by the material , it would be reflected .
When I first applied the chemical to the material , it became very rigid , so it was uncomfortable to use and had very little flexibility .
I used a slightly smaller amount of that chemical on the cloth to see whether this minor change in volume would make a difference to the secret substance I was using to make water reflect the cloth for military and other purposes , such as replacing umbrellas on a rainy day .
If this invention worked , I could achieve a great deal of success and make a lot of money ; I suspended the cloth again and applied the substance to see if it would work this time , and I could foresee that if my partners found out about my invention two things could happen : they would be proud of me and begin creating and developing new innovative ideas that could make significant progress for humanity , or they could be very angry with me because I did n't tell them about my project—since we are involved in a successful , ongoing project , they could be very disappointed in me for trying to create something else while we are still developing the invention we built about six months ago with a lot of hard work .

There 's no future for public transport because traveling by car is so much more convenient .
When you travel by car , you can have more privacy and go anywhere , anytime .
It 's more expensive but has a lot of advantages .
Public transport in the city is good , but punctuality is terrible : you often have to wait , and there are n't many routes to reach your destination .
There is n't much comfort , and sometimes you have to go without a seat .
Many times , traveling by bus is delayed and buses arrive crowded , so you waste time at every stop .
The people are different , and they are always different . No matter how much time passes , the people are different , and they like that .
Maybe poor people can buy a car too ; if it costs them a lot of money , they will buy it .
It 's a question of freedom and a concern for humanity .
No matter the improvements made to public transport , traveling by car has been and will remain the best choice for a future that is less rigid and compact and more flexible , fast , and convenient .
My favourite sport is yoga . It 's a fantastic sport .
I like yoga because it is a relaxing activity that lets us work both our mind and our body .
Yoga helps improve flexibility and concentration .
Yoga helps us live relaxed and accept life as it is .
It allows you to work on the organism using stretching techniques .
Yoga has many emotional , spiritual , and moral benefits that help us become better able to deal with the situations we face on a daily basis .
The advice I would give someone starting this sport is to relax and make the most of what yoga has to offer .
According to Lunde , 85 % of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
Yes , statistics from SC support this thesis .
These tragedies illustrate the effects of frustration on the human body .
People who murder others probably did n't go into the situation intending to murder them .
The person 's frustration led to anger and aggression that just got out of control .
Even small things , such as getting in the way of someone 's goals , can lead to frustration that results in aggressive acts such as murder .
These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence .
Through exposure , perhaps we have been desensitized to violence .
The media also plays a part in this flippancy .
After a character is shot , they often appear in the next scene .
Kids , in particular , are n't forming realistic schemas regarding violence .
The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes , leading to more rapes .
We , as potential parents , must instill in our children — the future presidents , doctors , teachers , and even murderers — a true understanding of aggression and the need to control it .
Racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago .
It actually appears to be declining .
This is evident , for example , in cartoons and TV shows : racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped .
Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed , perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitability and cognitive dissonance .
Perhaps through the media and other sources , some misconceptions are being cleared up and more realistic information is being provided to the public .
I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities between his ideas and the other person 's opinions , or present his own views and then adopt the other person 's opinions .
He should also appear competent , but not perfect ( the pratfall effect ) .
At first , he could pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain-loss theory ) .
The client should appear as attractive as possible without using his attractiveness to manipulate her .
The client can hope ( particularly if he is of average or lower attractiveness ) that she has moderately low self-esteem and will thus be less selective in her choices of dates or friends .
The client should also disclose personal information .
He tried to induce the client to like him .
This advice can be backed up by research .
It would be better for the client to ask the person for a favor because , due to cognitive dissonance , that person would view the client more favorably .
In discussing sensitivity , the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one 's own feelings and thoughts , and to the effects of one 's behaviour on others .
Only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others ' feelings .
Sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication .
Confrontation can make one more sensitive to one 's own behavior and how others interpret it .
One should be sensitive to others ' interpretations of one 's behavior so that one will know better how to act .
Michael arrived home at 5:45 p.m .
He went straight into his room with a furious expression .
He sat down on his bed , screaming .
After that , he began to smash his things .
His mother heard the noise and decided to see what was going on .
She took the stairs and went into Michael 's room .
She saw things lying everywhere .
She asked him why he did it .
Michael , instead of answering , shouted at her .
He and his mother clashed over something .
A while later , she left the room , leaving the door open .
At that moment , Michael began to calm down .
He thought about what he had done and let out a sigh .
Michael closed the door and , at that moment , knew he had made a mistake .
Genetic manipulation is an area that has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientific community , with both advantages and disadvantages .
One of the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms ' genetic makeup to man 's needs .
The possibilities are endless : a crop could be designed to grow in the dry , hot conditions of many developing countries , relieving them of the threat of starvation .
Cattle could be bred to be more efficient at converting plant energy into body mass , or diseases could even be killed off by altering people 's resistance to them .
Of course , to some extent , genetic manipulation already exists .
Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents , and gardeners crossbreed plants to suit their individual needs .
However , there is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
The advantages seem very favourable , and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much of the credit for them .
But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages associated with genetic manipulation ?
There are many possibilities for the misuse of this process .
It is a question of ethics and morals .
Is it right to try to change someone 's motives ?
Is it the right of one man to play God ?
It is also possible that we may not be able to control the new organisms created by genetic engineering .
A new plant that has an increased growth rate may seem like an answer to all our problems , but what would we do if it suddenly upset the ecosystem , drained the soil of its nutrients , and prevented other plants from growing ?
In theory , a scientist should take responsibility for this , but in an area such as genetic manipulation , about which we do not know a great deal , it may not be possible to find a solution .
Another problem would be the process of testing .
We are already close to the point where it is possible to test people 's genetic makeup to determine the likelihood of their developing certain illnesses .
Soon it may be possible for firms to employ only people with a certain expected lifespan , or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of genetic tests .
Although the threat of the Cold War has diminished , the technology developed through studies of genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands , particularly in the area of biological warfare .
Although scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life that their research brings , they would also be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology because of its many disadvantages .
I 'm so sorry for sending the email too late .
It 's nice to hear from you and to read your message .
The first days of March were terrible because I had a cold and then a toothache for about two weeks .
Now I had healed .
We are fine .
I 'm doing my job and studying for my master 's degree .
In the first semester of my master 's program , I am studying the following subjects : Thin Film Fabrication and Applications , Theoretical Physics , and Diffraction Methods . Theoretical Physics is a bit boring .
I am studying Raman spectroscopy .
I am glad the weather will be warming ; the temperature will rise from -4 to +2 degrees Celsius .
The problem is that there is not enough time to learn English .
It 's bad .
I 'm confused , but I know only one thing : I must study English .
It has long been discussed that people always learn valuable lessons from their mistakes .
Some people think there is no room for mistakes in daily life , at work , or even in their family .
However , I certainly consider mistakes to be a necessary step in our learning experience .
I am going to share a true story about Michael to support my viewpoint .
Michael was a six-year-old child who lived in the lovely countryside with his parents and his newborn brother , Tom .
In this small countryside town , Michael received all his parents ' love , attention , and passion .
Nonetheless , things were different until little Tom was born ; Michael suddenly stopped caring .
He felt deep despair and made every effort to get back the concern that belonged to him .
A zoo in southern France is home to millions of species .
This place is visited daily by many children and adults from that country and from other countries .
One day , some friends from the city where this zoo is located decide to stroll along the river , have a picnic , play football , and have a good time together .
They were on holiday .
Suddenly , while they were playing football and each eating a sandwich , Max saw a little lion that wanted to attack and take all of their food . Although it was a tender sight , Bob was a little scared .
Max was very fond of the animal because he thought it was very small and very playful ; otherwise , he and his three other friends would never have approached it .
It was dusk in the warm summer of southern France when we saw two security guards walking towards us from the city 's zoo ; we looked at each other and said that the animal had escaped from the zoo .
Finally , the starry sky , the full night , and everyone in your house .
He was very exhausted and said , " What an amazing day ! "
Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
I 'm so glad to hear you are coming !
You have no idea how happy I am .
In response to your question , I 'll tell you how to reach my house .
There are three possibilities .
First , you can take a taxi , but I must warn you about the taxi drivers .
They 're sly boots , and they could ask you to pay more than it really costs .
Secondly , you can take the bus .
Unfortunately , our buses are n't comfortable .
The last alternative , which I recommend to you , is my car !
I 'll pick you up at the airport , and it wo n't cost you anything .
Since you asked about the best places to visit , I 'd suggest a few , such as Oxford , London , and Piccadilly .
These places are really pulchritudinous !
I 'm sorry , I wo n't be able to accompany you on your excursions because I do n't have much free time and need to complete my assignments .
You 're lucky because museums and galleries are not too far from my house .
You can visit one of the UK 's most famous museums , such as the British Museum .
I recommend visiting the galleries at the Royal Academy of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery .
I 'm certain you will not be disappointed !
I had never felt so nervous in my life ; it was my first time on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
How could I possibly have known that , some months later , I would be performing for the president of our country in front of even more people ?
As I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye upon me , several things ran through my head .
I thought about losing consciousness , having a heart attack , or , even worse , being shouted down as a bad singer by someone in the audience .
At this point my knees started wobbling , and I felt as if my legs were made of pudding .
Whenever I flash back to those seconds that felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed to get on that stage , but somehow I finally found myself standing there , in slow motion reaching for the microphone , my hands shaking as if an earthquake had just struck .
The moment had come .
I inhaled and could almost feel the air expand my lungs .
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down , and tried to focus all my concentration on the first note , which ... did n't come .
Well , it did , but it was n't noticeable to anyone .
So I tried again , and suddenly my attitude changed from that of a nervous mouse to that of a woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .
The melody began to flow , and I happily filled the hall with music .
Like it says at the top , " There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient . "
Yes , I agree with that , because people are getting tired of waiting for buses or any public transport ; the personal car is now the power if you want to go ...
I do n't know . In a place like your holiday house , a bus might not be able to get there , and you might need a personal car .
If you want to move stuff from one place to another , you ca n't do that with a bus ; you need a personal car , so a personal car is better than a public transport vehicle .
The principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with information about the interests of young people in my country .
I am going to write about their interests in music , television programmes , and the clothes they usually wear , and conclude with my personal statement .
Firstly , by conducting a survey among young people in my area , I found that music is essential to them .
In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and by music videos .
By the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer is also their idol .
Secondly , young people expressed interest in films and television series .
Series have become so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching them on their electronic devices , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .
Moreover , sometimes young people become obsessed with TV series and lose their social lives .
Last but not least , youngsters are interested in fashion .
In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that she was very keen on being fashionable , and many said they loved having a wide range of clothes to show how stylish they were .
In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should consider all of these young people 's interests if the organisers want it to be a success .
In the picture , I can see a boy walking two dogs by the seaside .
I think he 's about 12 years old .
He is wearing a black-and-white jacket and black shorts .
He is shoeless .
One dog has brown fur ; its breed is a dachshund .
The second dog is white and its breed is Maltese .
The boy is looking at the dogs while leashing them .
It seems he is happy .
There are some rocks in the sea and on the beach , and there is also a bough lying on the sand .
The weather does n't look very bad , but it 's cloudy and I think it 's not so hot there .
Dear Jo ,
Firstly , I would like to thank you for visiting my country .
I am sure that my country is the best option .
The reason I say this is that it has plenty of wonderful scenery as well as career opportunities .
Next , I am proud to tell you about the beauty of my country .
There are 54 minority groups living together harmoniously in the S-shaped country .
Every minority lives in regions where it differs from the others .
My country has not only modern cities but also peaceful villages that evoke strong emotions .
In particular , I would say that the cuisine is something you should n't miss .
Then , despite being a developing country , it offers many opportunities to grow your career .
Nowadays , Vietnam is attracting foreign investment from many countries .
Besides that , the dominant industry is also improving significantly , especially in the export sector .
We mainly export agricultural products , such as rice and seasonal fruits and vegetables .
Travel services account for a large share of my country 's GDP and include many types of travel .
Finally , I am looking forward to seeing you in my country soon .
Sincerely ,
Ngoc Duong
A topic I like very much is electricity .
In today 's world , everyone uses electricity for almost everything .
It is present in your personal computer , lamps , and anything you need to plug in .
But almost no one knows that electricity travels a long way to reach your homes .
The journey starts at the power plant , where electricity is generated from sources such as water , wind , solar , and nuclear energy .
Then the electrical energy travels to the substation .
After this , the electrical energy needs to be reduced slightly to arrive at your house without problems ; this occurs in a place called a substation .
Therefore , we need to think carefully before wasting energy .
It is costly for you and especially for the environment .
Essay .
It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games .
Some people believe that it is a waste of time and a bad habit , while others think that it is a good way to spend their free time .
To my mind , there are pros and cons .
First of all , computer games can help you escape your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .
Apart from that , it is quite convenient , mainly because you stay at home and enjoy entertainment .
Also , video games are more interesting than traditional toys , so they capture teenagers ' interest .
Last but not least , some of them are educational and provide the ideal opportunity to learn .
On the other hand , there are many drawbacks .
To begin with , if you spend many hours in front of a computer screen , you can become addicted to it .
As a result , you do n't get together with your friends or communicate face-to-face .
In addition , many video games are full of violence , and teens tend to imitate them , leading to violent and aggressive behavior .
Also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes .
In conclusion , computer games are a nice way to spend your free time , but they should always be enjoyed in moderation .
I feel that the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives .
This has , realistically , been a relatively new invention , and in its short lifespan has been able to change the world significantly .
Not to mention how it will change people 's lifestyles in the future .
These changes resulting from the invention of the computer have been , I feel , both good and bad .
Technologically , computers have drastically improved people 's lives .
These are no longer the times when people have to write papers by hand or even with a simple typewriter .
Personal computers are becoming quite common , and therefore less expensive and easier to own .
Computers have also made life move much more quickly than before .
Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it opened .
We now have ATMs ( automatic teller machines ) that can perform the same transactions as a teller .
It seems that these days everything is run by computers !
We can complete our tasks much more efficiently .
Basically , every facet of life has been positively affected by computers .
While computers have brought about improvements , they have , in my opinion , also made the world more impersonal .
Jobs are being taken away from people who are not fast enough .
Interactions with humans in some places are nonexistent .
Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interaction between people .
In addition , it is very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine .
It is a common fact that machines do fail !
Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an oncoming obstacle is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?
People soon stop thinking and allow machines to do the work for them .
I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on wires .
Computers are not able to truly express or feel emotions and therefore are , in some instances , incapable of functioning .
With the invention of the computer come many changes in lifestyle , from the past to the future .
Some of these changes , such as advances in medical technology and safety , will save people 's lives .
But I fear that our world will become a very impersonal place .
I hope that we will be able to determine which improvements should be made and which should just remain slow .

I would like to recommend Mzoli 's restaurant .
It is a place located in the heart of Warsaw .
Many foreigners go there to try delicious traditional South African grilled food .
It is a rather informal restaurant designed in a rustic style , which guarantees a really nice ambiance .
When it comes to food , you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic .
As for the service , I can only call it unusual : you choose your meat , the staff prepares your dish , then you go to the kitchen to pick it up and eat it with your hands .
I have been there once , and I really like that place . You feel at home , and the food is delicious .
This is also the cheapest price I could find in this country .
The main reason I like that place is that I can see many people from different parts of the world .
I have been there several times , but I would still like to go again with my classmates .
The best film .
I am a fan club for the film called High School Musical .
High School Musical is the best film I have ever seen .
When you see the thriller , you can stop looking for it and immediately want to see the film .
It 's a move that everyone can see .
I think I find it exciting because I love films like that .
This great movie is about a group of students who attend secondary school . Their school is not like other schools ; it 's different because it offers a lot of activities , like basketball , theater , etc .
I think people would like to see it because when you see it , you can stop and enjoy a lot of music and people dancing .
In my opinion , it 's the best film I 've ever seen , and if you have the opportunity to see it , do so .
Fox hunting should be banned because it is a cruel sport .
There are many people trying to stop the sport from taking place .
People hunt and kill foxes partly because foxes kill chickens and partly because people enjoy the social aspect of the sport .
At present , I am sure farmers can come up with some way to prevent foxes from getting at their chickens .
If they did this , there would be no need to kill foxes or go on hunts .
When hunts take place , the foxes and other wildlife are harmed .
Some animals ' homes may be destroyed , and some innocent animals may be harmed .
Once the foxes are caught , they are said to suffer a horrible death , and if this continues , it will be unfair .
Many people have no problem with foxes , but the hunt should not be considered a sport , as it would not be fun to experience .
If fewer foxes are killed , there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops , so this will be a benefit to many farmers , and it is not cruel ; it is just the way of life .
Fox hunting is a horrible sport because the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback .
The fox is then chased until it is caught .
Thinking about this is very upsetting , and most people would be relieved if fox hunting were banned .
Foxes have as much right to be on this earth as we do , and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .
I am sure nobody would want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt , so I do not see why we should put foxes through it .
If foxes are unable to harm farm animals , there is no danger in banning the sport .
The reason fox hunting should continue is to keep the number of foxes down and to prevent changes in the food chain .
Foxes are not needed to keep down the rabbit population , as farmers are able to use poisons to kill the rabbits .
If you ban fox hunting , it means that the protesters will have won , and it gives them an incentive to protest about something else .
A few people enjoy the sport , which allows them to socialise .
I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned , as it is very cruel .
Another reason it should not be banned is that foxes inflict a cruel death on chickens when they kill them .
If they decide they must continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned and a more humane method should be considered .
Report .
This report will examine whether cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities .
The number of cars has increased in countries in the last decade .
Too many cars driving around people can be a serious problem to deal with .
But what should we do to make up for it ?
There are some pros and cons .
Pros
First , there would be less noise in the streets .
This is particularly true in Spain , where city centres are usually quite narrow .
Second , there would be less air pollution .
It has been proved that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to health .
Third , cities would be friendlier to live in .
Places where people can enjoy walking .
Cons
First , the livelihoods of local sellers in the area could be harmed because they might need to load and unload goods for their shops .
Second , people who live in that part of the city may be negatively affected because they may need to drive through it to get home .
In my opinion , it would be a good idea to do it , but we would need to balance different interests to do it right .
Some people believe that computers will replace books in the future .
I believe this is true because computers are more convenient and easier to use .
Tablets are light , and you only need to carry one instead of many heavy books .
And it is common knowledge that gadgets make our lives easier .
But some people have a different opinion about it .
Firstly , studying at school has become simpler : students can find a lot of different information about interesting subjects .
I do n't know where to start .
I 'm only going to bare my heart to my computer .
I feel lonely myself .
I do n't know exactly what I need or what I should do .
But I understand that I definitely need to make some changes in my life .
I wish some really pleasant and enjoyable events would burst into my life .
It must happen , I 'm sure .
The question is how long I still have to wait .
My patience is already running out .
I refuse to understand and accept the fact that I ca n't afford a luxurious life .
Yes , I was always dreaming of wealth .
I am not a greedy or avaricious person .
I only want my wishes to be fulfilled .
I do n't have many desires .
I only wish that my loved ones are healthy , wealthy , and happy .
I wish my husband , my daughters , and I were traveling a lot ; we love each other and have enough money for everything we want .
The Single European Act , signed in February 1986 by the heads of government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and coming into force on 1 July 1987 , aims to create a single market by the end of 1992 .
This major target is to be attained by removing all fiscal , technical , and physical barriers .
This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell their goods in any member state ; an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state ; and a person with national qualifications would also be able to work in any member state .
There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system .
Despite the fact that the proposals to amend the Treaty of Rome were put forward by an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , as shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and by letters to leading national newspapers , whereas Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission , described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .
In accordance with the constitutional law of the United Kingdom , Parliament is the supreme law-making body .
Consequently , the emergence of another source of law , deemed to be supranational , is inevitably a problem .
One of the prerogative powers conferred on Parliament is the power to make treaties .
However , these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals , so where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not rely on the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by an Act of Parliament .
This acts as a curb on the enforcement of European Community law , so that , to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is retained .
Yet this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there is a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community law .
Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in many areas , such as freedom of movement , transportation , and work , there are also several disadvantages , including a loss of sovereignty to some extent .
Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts and omissions of individuals on a personal basis , for example , in criminal law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .
Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community law , but any later statutes passed by the British Parliament will also be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid .
In conclusion , it is reasonable to infer that Britain 's sovereignty may be impaired in many ways , although only within the sphere where Community law prevails over national law .
In other respects , the sovereignty of Britain will be safeguarded , for Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
The turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe .
Each decade has introduced a new fad or discovery that has become fixed in our minds as typical of the era .
The Roaring Twenties , for example , were marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile .
It was a very capricious decade , which can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the Great Depression of the 1930s .
How could we ever forget the " Fabulous Fifties " or the hippie decades of the 1960s and 1970s ?
Change is inevitable , and while it is difficult to pinpoint any single accomplishment of the 20th century as the most remarkable , one aspect of that century will remain with me forever .
As we embark on the year 2000 , I think it is only fair to call the 20th century " The Century of Democracy . "
Perhaps it is because today is November 4th , the day after the U.S. elections .
Perhaps it is because the former superpower , the Soviet Union , is now transitioning to democracy .
Perhaps it 's because I 'm thousands of miles from my home that I 'm feeling very patriotic these days .
No , I 'm not engulfed by the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen of the United States .
Rather , I feel patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place for people of all nations to live .
In the past 2 years alone , we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe .
I remember , not long ago , the pro-democracy demonstrations that led the people of East and West Germany to unite as a single democratic nation .
At the World Expo in Seville , not a month ago , I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall—the wall that was , to many , a symbol of the harsh realities of the Cold War .
That wall is gone forever , and I feel lucky to be among the many who were able to witness its fall .
The Soviet Union is also going through its own transition to democracy .
Many unhappy people in this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid it of its communist government .
The superpower among superpowers , which to me had long been the example of Marxism , is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world .
With the end of the Cold War , relations throughout the world have become more peaceful .
The idea of a nuclear war is practically nonexistent today .
Arms sales have gone down so that nations can spend this money on more worthwhile areas .
In conclusion , as the turn of the century slowly approaches , I look back with a feeling of accomplishment and forward with anticipation for what lies ahead .
In a world of many scattered nations , conflict is inevitable .
However , if we all have one bond—democracy—then maybe , together , we can learn to understand one another and work towards a happier world for all .
It is a well-known fact that everybody needs holidays .
To begin with this topic , we need to ask ourselves several questions and keep certain matters in mind .
First , we must consider our financial situation , the season , the people who will accompany us , transportation , accommodation , the destination , and other matters to note when we decide to go on holiday .
Secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or staying at home .
This could be the first question we ask before going on holiday .
Nowadays , due to globalization and the increasing number of flights around the world , we can find a wide range of websites where airlines offer their services at incredibly low prices .
Because of these low prices , many people decide to go abroad instead of travelling near their homes .
Of course , to plan a good trip you must also consider accommodation , food , etc . Depending on the place you choose , you will spend more or less .
Another point to consider is the environment : if you go abroad , you can visit the world 's best-known monuments and natural and historical sites ; if you stay in your country , although you can certainly see many places , the things to see are more limited .
In conclusion , I think a person must consider several factors when planning a holiday trip ; it depends on their knowledge about where to go and how to decide whether a trip will be cheap or expensive .
Dear Sir ,
My name is Tomas García , and I am writing about the advertisement that appeared in the newspaper yesterday for a summer camp job .
I am 25 years old and come from Spain .
My mother tongue is Spanish , but I can speak English fluently too .
Besides , as you can see from my enclosed CV , I obtained a law degree and worked for companies such as ..... and .... in roles very similar to the position you are offering .
That is why I consider that my experience and qualifications fit the requirements of this position very well .
Moreover , I would like to point out that I have always been interested in working with people , particularly in taking care of little children and helping them to be happy .
For all these reasons , I consider myself a very suitable candidate for this position , and I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and discuss this vacancy with you further .
My contact information is in the attached CV for your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
The European Community is a grouping of 12 sovereign European states whose intention is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
Its intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods , services , capital , and the workforce .
Competition for trade is so great in modern times that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
Britain has been recognised for its particular expertise in banking and insurance .
The European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill on a much larger scale .
The creation of a single European commercial market will benefit consumers since harmonisation of standards is being introduced , hopefully to the highest common standard .
The European Community does not serve only as a useful trade association ; environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if it confronts them collectively .
Cooperation between the communities ' police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug smuggling and terrorism .
The common defence policy for such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources .
However , some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur .
The Single European Act was designed to speed up the decision-making of certain institutions .
The Act meant that member governments had to be committed to the greatest cooperation and joint action in the areas of foreign , social , and environmental policies , thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members .
The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law , which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty .
Greater participation in European Parliament elections would help elect those best able to promote British interests in Europe .
The question is how much sovereignty Britain is prepared to lose and whether the benefits of belonging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages .
A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt , and over the next few years it will increase .
As far as the immediate future is concerned , a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress .
In most earlier studies , the effects of either ocean acidification or warming were investigated one at a time .
However , in nature these stressors affect the organism in combination , and their combined effect may be greater than that of a single stressor .
I remember how the old people treated their children .
They were all poor ; they did n't have enough money to pay for their children 's education .
All the children should help their parents .
Some of them have been adopted by other parents .
The children want to get an education , but they do n't have enough money to pay for it .
Some of the children worked in the sugar-cane fields or in shops to earn money to feed themselves , and many kind people treated them well .
Nowadays , many people have changed their lifestyles .
And their lives have become birds in the sky .
Some of them have already achieved their life goals .
They have plenty of money , and their children have everything they want , but some of the children have very bad manners .
They do n't respect their parents , and they do n't think about what they 're doing .
Some of them have already given birth to a child or gotten married at the age of sixteen .
The world has already changed now .
They have good doctors who are qualified and highly skilled .
Many people developed their own countries .
For example , they want to attract more and more tourists to their country .
Some of the children who are eighteen have already left home to live with their girlfriends .
They did not remember what their parents had done for them .
People have changed their lifestyle .
Some boys like to get a new hairstyle .
Like girls , they like to wear many accessories and use makeup .
They want to introduce a new fashion to make a name for themselves .
People became more skilled and more ill-mannered .
In the next 50 years , people will create many electronic things , such as cars and televisions .
Television has brought many advantages that our great-grandparents could never have envisaged .
People will develop more model televisions .
Year by year , the world will change and become more developed .
Long ago , early cars had wooden bodies , which made them extremely vulnerable in a crash .
About 30 years ago , cars switched to all-steel bodies .
Today , cars are stronger , lighter , and safer than earlier designs .
It means that today people are creating more new features .
Television is an interesting source of information people watch every day ; from comedy programs to quantum physics , it can serve as an object of study , but it is only another tool in your investigation .
If you arrive in the morning , there is TV news ; it has good ratings , and people need daily information about the world .
If you come in the afternoon , you 'll find children and young people , but what they are really interested in is that everyone wants to watch soap operas at this hour and see comedies or interesting documentaries about whatever they want .
Hi Ana ,
Yes , I am in the process of learning English right now .
Coincidentally , I now work in the IT sector ; therefore , I need this language for my daily communication with customers .
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions .
Thanks ,
Alex
I do n't agree .
I think public transport is the future .
Also , I think this applies to many things .
Now we live in a shared world where everything is shared : work , development , ideas , and many other things .
This is a new philosophy .
The basis of this philosophy is " to share . "
This idea brings great benefits to everyone .
Is the same true for the transport ?
If we shared transport ( used public transport ) , there would be fewer cars , and therefore less pollution and less traffic .
Everybody saves money , and the familiar economy is better .
The cities become more agile , and it is easier to get to places .
This model has many advantages .
We need to solve the problems of the traditional model because otherwise traffic becomes worse and travel times for both types of transport can increase dramatically . It is more comfortable and quicker to travel by personal transport , but if only one mode of transport existed it would be more efficient and more comfortable for all of us .
I think the whole world would benefit : the environment , people , families , work , and so on .
I agree with this statement . I think the future will be one in which everyone has their own car and does n't use public transport .
Nowadays , everyone wants to live conveniently .
So they just buy a new car for themselves to use .
But some people ca n't buy it .
Because they do n't have enough money , they have material problems .
So they use public transport .
Poor people are treated as untouchables .
In my opinion , using public transport will not be as popular as travelling by car .
In my opinion , public transportation has a bright future because many people live in big cities and do not use cars to get around ; public transport is more convenient : they can take a bus , then the subway , and finally arrive wherever they want .
But if they use the car , they 'll probably be late for the place they 're going .
I think if people used public transport there would be less pollution , the city 's sky would be blue instead of grey , and nobody should say that public transport has no future .
Moreover , a lot of people use public transport because they do n't have a car .
In conclusion , people today are very conscious about the environment and the pollution produced by cars , so they do n't use cars much ; I do n't think this means the end of public transport .
Today we watch a lot of television . I think this is not a good thing because watching more television can make you lazy .
In addition , most of these programs are stupid , good only for wasting your time .
The reason is that many people do n't want to hear bad news ; they only want to be entertained .
Fortunately , not all TV channels have these programs .
Someone is trying to invent new programs to educate people .
One of these is Channel 5 . During the day , it broadcasts some interesting programs about history and nature .
I strongly believe it 's possible to do both programs .
For example , during the day it 's possible to mix news , quiz programs , documentaries , and interviews .
If we have channel programs like these , I am sure that all Italian citizens would benefit and gain more knowledge about our beautiful world .
Dear Alison ,
How are you doing ? I 'm writing to let you know about the eating habits and customs in my country .
In Argentina , the most typical foods are empanadas , mate , and dulce de leche .
I am a hundred percent sure that everyone in this country has already tried empanadas at least once .
We usually have breakfast as soon as we wake up .
Most people drink chocolate milk and eat biscuits for breakfast .
We also have tea time and we eat the same thing as in the morning . I know that might sound kind of weird to you . We have lunch at twelve o'clock and dinner around ten o'clock .
What really makes a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , most commonly the barbecue , shared with the whole family .
It 's a custom that I hope I will never lose . You should come visit me and experience it for yourself ; I 'm sure you 'll love it !
I hope my letter has helped you !
Best wishes
Belu
Lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose its important role .
First of all , travelling by car is much more convenient .
Actually , you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or the shopping mall , but also to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , plane , or bus .
Actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common to be stuck on the road .
But it could be much the same when travelling by bus or by other means of transport .
Secondly , cars are becoming cheaper day by day , so everyone can afford one , even those who are not considered wealthy .
So far , public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally friendly , and fast .
On the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a negative impact on air quality and are one of the most important causes of pollution .
On the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airlines undoubtedly have a great impact on air pollution .
Anyway , it may be possible to travel by car , and when you arrive at a destination , you can choose to cycle or walk instead of taking buses , trains , the underground , or other forms of public transport .
Cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much healthier , cheaper , and faster .
We must also take into consideration that the car industry has developed many new vehicles .
New models , such as electric cars , are now available and environmentally friendly ; they are affordable , so everyone can buy one .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that travelling by car will become increasingly faster , cheaper , and even less harmful to the environment .
I think doing sports is healthy .
When we exercise , our body and mind feel better .
My favourite sport is yoga .
I go to the gym three times a week .
I love it because when the class finishes , I feel good .
I sometimes take a walk in the forest .
I did the Camino de Santiago 10 years ago .
I like it very much .
I walked 760 km .
I started in Roncesvalles and I finished in Santiago de Compostela .
This way is so beautiful .
I met a lot of people from other countries , such as Brazil , Germany , and Australia .
A car might be more comfortable , but it is still riskier than a train or a bus .
I prefer to use my own car because of the long distance between my home and my workplace .
Michael was just sitting there , wondering what would come next in his life .
Time passed , and the answers still had n't come to him ; that was the moment he decided to make things happen .
He took a bag filled with clothes and snacks ; no matter what , this would become the adventure of his life , a new beginning .
He walked outside his home and took the very first cab he saw .
" Nowhere " was written in bold black letters on a sign in the front window of that cab .
He started wondering about the infinite choices ahead of him .
" Just take me to a bar , " he thought to himself , but no , that was too simple .
" Take me to the airport , " he repeated in his mind , but no , that is too crazy .
" Just drive , it does n't matter where , " he said to the taxi driver , whispering to his feet , " Maybe I should not run away . "
He felt guilty about leaving the very second he grabbed the cab door .
Was it because of her wife ?
No .
Was it because of her daughter ?
No .
Was it because of his poorly paid job ?
No .
It was because he had not had the courage before ; it had been selfish and incorrect .
But the question running through his mind was , " Does that really matter ? "
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is true that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
But at the same time , it also consumes much more energy than travelling by public transport .
Rather than saying there is no future for public transport , we should seek ways to improve it .
I think it is more accurate to say that there is no future for individual auto transport .
Because of global warming , many countries , including Taiwan , Turkey , and Germany , have started promoting public transport to protect the environment .
Their government is trying to increase the price of oil and decrease public transport prices .
The government is trying to make us use public transport more .
I think it still has a limited impact on our society .
The most efficient way is to promote it ourselves .
We should all start using public transport and tell people how good it is for our planet .
I guess more people will start doing it .
Social networks
If you want to talk with your friends , share photos , or post whatever you want , you have many opportunities to do so on social networking sites .
Nowadays , people use the Internet for everything — from finding information and sharing photos to uploading videos and other useful activities .
So , social networks are now very widespread on the internet .
The most popular social networks are Facebook , Twitter , Yahoo , Flickr , WhatsApp , Tumblr , Ask.fm , etc .
Let 's take Facebook as an example .
Facebook is the biggest and most used social network .
It has more than 1 billion users .
You can use a Facebook account to text your friends , keep in touch with them , share your own experiences , receive notifications , upload photos and videos , and , of course , see what your friends post .
You can also see their opinions and what 's new in politics , business , and entertainment .
You can promote your own business so your products and services can find their target more easily .
Facebook has many benefits , but it can also be very dangerous .
There are so many people on the internet who pretend to be someone else .
Now , let me tell you my " Facebook story " .
When I was 11 years old , I had my first Facebook account .
I was so excited about it !
I felt like I had just discovered the technology .
I started posting photos of myself , sharing videos , updating my status , and meeting new people .
Then I thought it would be " cooler " to write on Facebook that I live in the Netherlands and work at Jack Daniel 's .
I remember that I used to answer everybody , no matter who they were .
I talked with Romanians , Indians , Arabs , and other strangers .
I did n't realise I was in danger .
Two years later , when I was 13 years old , I started to realise that my old photos , videos , and status updates were completely stupid , and I decided to delete them all .
I also changed my workplace and country and deleted unknown people from my friends list , but I made a really big mistake : I made my phone number public !
One week after making my phone number public , many strangers called me , and some of them called from private numbers .
I really did n't like it !
I 'm 15 years old now , and I think I 'm mature enough to use Facebook . I 've learned a lot from the big mistakes I 've made on Facebook so far .
I do n't accept friend requests from people I do n't know , I do n't talk to strangers , I do n't give out my personal data ( especially my phone number ) , and I think twice before posting anything .
I 'm thinking now : What was going through my mind when I was talking to strangers ?
Oh my God , I was in serious danger !
I want to give you some advice : do n't let your children access Facebook if they are under 13 , because they can be very naive and psychos , rapists , etc. , are everywhere on the Internet .
In my opinion , social networks can be useful if you know how to use them and do n't let them control you .
I have a dream .
I do n't know whether it seems big or not .
But I really want to make it come true .
My dream originates with Messi . I do n't know how , but he is my inspiration , maybe .
He gave me a dream of going abroad .
Then I will meet him .
Yes .
He is also my motivation .
Young people 's tastes : health and fitness
Nowadays , there 's a great deal of information available both on the Internet and on TV about how to be fit and why it 's so important to stay healthy .
However , are young people aware of these facts ?
I believe most of them do n't pay enough attention to their health and fitness because they spend a lot of time drinking and smoking .
Despite going to the gym , they behave badly at the weekend , for example when they go clubbing .
On the other hand , I believe that many young people have fun without using drugs or alcohol .
They also go to the gym , play sports , and follow a healthy diet .
In my opinion , you need to be fit to stay healthy .
You should go on a diet and exercise .
If you do that , your body will respond better than you expect .
Regrettably , our lifestyle involves both going to the gym to get fit and going out to drink alcohol .
Both are impossible .
Hey , it 's me , Satyajit .
I am a student .
I am going to appear for the JEE Main entrance exam in Bhubaneswar , Odisha , India .
I am a fan of SRK .
I love you , Simpy ...
Would you like to come ?
Wawel - the administrative center of the old capital city .
Wawel was one of the most important places in Central Europe for most of the Middle Ages .
At a time when Poland was one of the strongest countries in the world and the strongest in Central Europe , the bravest Polish king and leaders lived and ruled .
Wawel is the number-one place in Kraków for visitors because , apart from its rich history , you can find many fine monuments and works of art , and , obviously , you can get a lot of interesting information on a guided tour .
Apart from tourism , Wawel 's history is still being made — there you can visit the cemetery where many of Poland 's most famous leaders are buried , such as Jan III Sobieski , Józef Piłsudski , and Lech Kaczyński , who was President of Poland until recently .
In conclusion , Wawel is a place worth visiting if you are planning to visit southern Poland ; the revitalisation of the city of Kraków is also beautiful , so everything comes together well .
People who are planning to see Wawel should n't forget the other interesting places around it , like Sukiennice , Smok Wawelski , and many wonderful temples ; none are more than a few hundred meters from Wawel .
Dear Jen ,
Last week I went on an educational trip with some classmates and my class adviser .
We visited the National Museum .
It was nice to see the old relics that have been preserved for a long time and are still used today to help us learn about what happened in the past .
After the trip , we have lunch at a nearby chain restaurant .
We enjoyed discussing the trip .
It was the day before yesterday , but Michael did not know it yet .
He just knew that he had to get to work on the novel he so desperately wanted to finish , but he had not managed to complete a single chapter so far .
He placed himself in front of the oak desk , opened his silver laptop , and stared at the blank white page of the document .
He did not know what to write even though he knew the story , the characters , the plot , and the twists at the end .
He knew the complexity , the essence , the feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write .
Suddenly , he felt his mind running in circles , spiralling into the unknown ; his fingers blazed over the keyboard faster than he ever had before , and the words assembled , gathered and became sentences—structured organisations of semantic meaning—and the chapter was finished .
He had no doubt that the inspiration came from above .
He closed the writing program . When asked whether to save the changes , he pressed " Do n't Save " as he always did when he had n't written anything , and then put on his jacket to go for a celebratory walk .
He went out the door , turned on his heel , and looked back at his computer with a strange sensation in his stomach .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Hello , my name is Rolle .
I was born at Danderyds Sjukhus in 2000 .
I have a brother , Trogen .
He is 13 years old .
My favorite sport is ice hockey .
I am playing for SDE Hockey .
I started to play ice hockey when I was 6 years old .
I think my favorite place is Tigerbalsamhallen . I play hockey there because I love to play hockey .
Three words that describe me are happy , hockey , and friends .
I do not have a favorite movie .
I like many movies , and the same goes for songs .
I like house music , and one of my favorite artists is Avicii .
I do n't want to miss the party because it is so funny .
Kebab is my favorite food .
My favorite restaurant is Nico 's Pizzeria because it has the best kebab .
One of my favorite memories is when I was in New York and watched the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden .
Dear Sir ,
I am writing regarding your request for recommendations of places for your students to visit .
To be honest , four hours is not much for sightseeing in my city , and I have been thinking about it a lot , but I think I may finally have a perfect idea .
I do not know if you have heard about our old castle .
It 's in the very centre of the town , so it 's very close to the hostel where you 're staying .
We can visit it ; it 's open from eight to twelve ( I checked ) . They have wonderful exhibitions there : paintings , sculptures , historical items , and a few more modern pieces as well .
The best part is that at 1 p.m. , there will be a concert .
My friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as an accompaniment to the slideshow of old photographs from the 19th century .
I think it would be best if we went together at ten in the morning , looked at some paintings for two hours , then went for ice cream or pizza—or whatever the kids would like during the break—and then returned to the castle for the show .
Later we can do whatever you would like .
If you have any questions , just write to me or call me on my cellphone at 123 456 .
Yours faithfully ,
Sebastian Duźniak
When I started thinking about my favourite sport , it was quite difficult for me to decide , since I 'm very keen on practising sports .
For as long as I can remember , I 've been involved in sports .
Nevertheless , if I had to choose one among all of them , running could be considered my favourite one .
Running is one of the cheapest and easiest sports to practice anywhere and at any time .
All you need to do is spend half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
An increasingly debated issue is whether fox hunting should be banned .
In today 's society , it is an outdated and barbaric " sport " that , in my opinion , should be banned .
In this country , animal rights have been debated in parliament , and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals ' welfare .
Recently the British government has introduced legislation on how animals that are to be slaughtered should be transported .
These measures include the time the animals spend on the road and the amount of space they have .
etc .
However , it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs , watch the dogs pursue it until it is exhausted , and then see it torn apart .
This , apparently , is a sport .
The government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers , while dogs are still allowed to attack foxes .
Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government .
It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators .
At least if one dog fights another , the fight is in some respects fair .
But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others .
The fox stands no chance . Why is fox hunting legal , whereas all other blood sports are banned ?
Fox hunting is , for the most part , enjoyed by the upper class .
It is expensive to take part in , as you need a horse , dogs , and riding equipment .
( helmet , boots , etc . )
You also need land to do it on .
It is my opinion that the Conservative government will not ban fox hunting because it will lose the support and funding of its upper-class , wealthy supporters who fox hunt .
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals , surely something should be done to protect the fox .
The British government is always among the first to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( e.g. , when banning whaling ) , and it is very ready to attack countries that kill wild animals ( e.g. , for destroying habitats in the Brazilian rainforests ) .
But when it comes to stopping the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britain 's few native animals , they seem to turn a blind eye .
According to people who partake in fox hunting , it is an enjoyable sport .
A sport is an activity in which two evenly matched teams or individuals compete for enjoyment or a prize .
It could be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven , as the result would be a foregone conclusion .
If one boxer had to fight ten boxers , this would be unfair .
But matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight to the death is still considered a sport .
Cricket is a sport ; the brutal chase and killing of a fox for the enjoyment of the upper class is not .
Famous people , such as politicians , film stars , and other celebrities , are ordinary people , as we are .
People always idolise them and think they are unusual , but they simply have extraordinary careers .
First of all , everyone deserves a private life free from journalists , even if they live in the limelight .
They should be able to spend time with their children , families , and friends , go on holiday , and celebrate special occasions .
On the other hand , I think it 's impossible for people like this to have private lives , because fans and society want to know everything about them .
They want to be in touch with their idols , to contact them , and to meet them in person .
To sum up , if we are a famous person , we should bear in mind that fans will admire us , and journalists will come to us , take photos of us , and publish them in gossip magazines or tabloids , all to satisfy the fans .
Stars should realise that they are the centre of attention .
In addition , should they choose which is more important to them : career or private life ?
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the summer camp position .
I 'm a 20-year-old student who loves taking care of children .
For me , this would be an incredible experience to improve my skills in helping with organisation and cooking .
I am a girl full of energy and always keep a smile on my face .
I think I am a great candidate for your job ; if you need some further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Best wishes , Andrea .
When the time came for Lucy to transition from being a teenager to an adult , all her self-assurance and determination vanished into thin air .
She had been a brilliant student in high school and intended to remain so .
She expected to work and study all at the same time .
She had big plans , but sometimes she had to slow down to achieve them .
She was going to study journalism and do a part-time job in the meantime .
She went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in a market , but by the end of the month reality hit her in the face .
She became exhausted , and her performance at university suffered .
She needed to stop working or studying because her health was at risk : she fell asleep in class and at work , her diet was poor , and she had a terrible temper .
She could only understand how disastrous her life was when she reached her limit .
Even though nobody pushed her , she was taking on so many responsibilities that she could n't accomplish them .
'Why are you running when you 're just learning to walk ? '
One of her friends told her once .
' I want to make my future and I do n't want to waste time , ' she retorted . But was she happy ?
Since then , she has asked herself many questions , and doubts have been her faithful companions .
During the week of exams , she suffered her first panic attack .
That was the sign that it was definitely time for a change .
A friend of hers took her to a therapist , and after a few sessions she began to catch a glimpse of what it was all about .
'Success is not final , failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue that counts . '
Her therapist said .
Finally , there was the clue .
She would have to work on that all her life , though .
Her biggest challenge was learning to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day , so she would have to enjoy the journey and give her best over and over again .
Hello there , my good folks at Dischan .
My name is Sigfried Jensen , and I would like to apply for a position as a musician with your company .
I have no formal education that documents my compositional abilities , so I will let my compositions speak for themselves .
I can compose both standard and looping music in whatever style you require . On top of this , I can also edit and polish given audio samples to make them usable in various new scenarios .
If your demand for music is n't high enough , I also possess secondary skills in marketing , market communications , and general electronics .
Moreover , I can also provide minor visual designs if need be .
My previous work experience is somewhat limited : it consists of a couple of years as a musician for a small media company called Dischan , as well as a short period working as a TV and general electronics repair technician for various companies , including B & O .
How important is it for you to read books in English ?
In my opinion , it is important because it improves my vocabulary and helps me express ideas easily .
Could you tell me whether you have reading habits for learning English ?
I do n't have reading habits for learning English . In my opinion , it 's a habit I should have developed when I was a child because I would have grown up with reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
Do you think it is difficult for you to create the habit of reading to learn English ?
I think it is difficult for me to develop reading habits because I do n't like reading , but I think it is possible if I practice .
Most infant educators , psychologists , and education professionals think that using storytelling in early childhood education is good for children 's development .
But ... is it that good ?
Does storytelling have any disadvantages ?
Using storytelling is a good way to work on values and emotions , since they are too young to express them on their own .
They see themselves in the main character , and through his experiences they can learn how to act in such situations .
For instance , if the story is about fear ( an emotion that makes them feel insecure ) and ends well , they will have different methods to overcome their fear and feel more secure and self-confident .
Furthermore , they can take part in and build their own stories .
Their vocabulary will increase as they work on their social skills .
In addition , they can see that every act has consequences for which they are responsible .
However , there are some points that need to be considered .
Storytelling must be chosen according to the pupils ' ages .
One of the reasons storytelling may not work is that some teachers expect more of their pupils than they can manage .
Moreover , if the story is too long or dull , they will easily lose concentration and cause their classmates to lose it too .
To sum up , we must take advantage of storytelling to consolidate concepts , values , and emotions , and let imagination run free .
I live in one of the biggest cities in the country .
People who live in our city generally face transportation problems .
Instead of long-term solutions , local authorities are focusing on short-term solutions .
The quality of public transportation vehicles can be improved .
A new form of public transportation must be supported by the government .
People should be encouraged to use public transport .
The human brain is the most powerful computer known to man , yet it is small and light .
It is the control centre of the body ; it can instruct the body to move freely around its surroundings and interact with other humans and objects .
The brain can make decisions ; it can communicate .
The only function of the brain that computers can rival is memory .
Since the invention of electronic calculators , some human brain functions , such as accounting , have been taken over by computers .
In fact , the whole field of mathematics has been accelerated by the invention of the electronic calculator .
But the subject has not changed ; electronics has only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
Most of the theories used today were hypothesized and proven before the invention of the calculator .
Computers , however , have almost unimaginable accuracy .
Most high-precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to make parts accurate to within thousandths of a millimeter .
The computer is very widely used in the modern world , but in almost every case it is only an aid to the brain .
The human still has to tell the computer what to do .
The human is still in charge .
The human brain is in no way made redundant by the invention of the computer , and I think it will be a long time before technology is developed to build an electronic machine that can compete with the brain in performing even one of its functions , never mind all those the human brain is capable of doing .
Hello , Tara .
You are starting an amazing project in your life .
I know it is really difficult to start , but then it becomes easier .
You can start by asking your teacher and your schoolmates if they want to be part of it .
They will probably say yes .
Together you can decide what to do .
At my school , I made that , and it worked .
We started by creating rules to respect the environment . I do n't want to give you any more ideas because it 's important to be original .
Good luck
João
If car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate , the roads will be completely congested .
This is the main problem facing the UK 's transport system .
The reasons for this are many and varied .
People today want more freedom and have more disposable income , both of which will lead to an increase in car ownership .
Many people also feel unsafe walking or using public transport to get around , and mothers who used to walk to school when they were young now insist on ferrying their children to school by car , as they believe , correctly or not , that there are too many child abductors around for children to be safe on the streets .
These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case and the Fred and Mary West case , which received extensive publicity and increased public awareness .
People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport : they can travel whenever they wish and go door-to-door instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations .
The enormous number of vehicles on the roads has meant that traveling by bicycle has become unacceptable to many people because of the danger and the levels of pollution from cars .
Rail travel has declined in popularity in recent years due to the growing popularity of cars .
Some people may not use trains because of their seemingly unreliable service .
Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars , as passengers are tied to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
I think that the government should help Britain 's transport by reducing car use and increasing the use of buses , trains , and other forms of public transport .
The government should do this by investing more money in public transport than in road improvements such as widening motorways .
This increased investment would make public transport more attractive by providing more scheduled services , lower fares , and fewer delays .
These factors may lead people to switch from using their cars to travel to work or school to using buses or trains instead .
This would lead to less-congested roads that could be used more efficiently by people with no other option , and to a less polluted environment for all of us to live in .
This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car use .
Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products .
Several years ago , the disease BSE , or 'mad cow disease , ' became quite common among cattle .
The disease causes mental impairment , so the cow can not think for itself and slowly dies .
This BSE is known to cross species barriers ; several sheep contracted a similar disease after eating feed made from the remnants of dead , meat-stripped cows .
Now , scientists fear that it has crossed the species barrier from cattle to humans , as cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) have become more frequent .
There is , as yet , no cure for this disease , and the only way humans can contract it is by eating beef products .
This has clearly put many people off beef . The press has also reported on the government 's inefficient quality control , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
The disease can take up to 15–20 years to become evident in humans , so even if people gave up beef today , they would still have a chance of getting CJD .
However , giving up these products now would reduce the chance of becoming crippled by this disease in the future .
If a lot of people give up beef products , this will affect the agricultural industry .
Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no one wants to buy their meat .
It will also affect other animals sold for meat : more people will want to buy meat from sheep , pigs , and so on , so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
The whole episode may drive the price of beef down , so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than fork out for more expensive meat .
If no one wants to eat beef , cows will only be bred for their milk , which means there may be fewer cows in the future .
If cows are no longer required by the public for food , some abattoir workers may lose their jobs , and several butchers , for whom money from beef products constitutes a considerable percentage of their income , may be hit hard by this .
The politicians still say that it is safe and that they will continue to eat beef .
However , many of these people are elderly , and by the time the disease develops in them , it wo n't really be considered a premature death .
However , for us young people , is the risk too great ?
I have n't stopped eating it .
I am a native Italian speaker and a final-year student in Linguistic Mediation at the University of Rome .
English , French , and German are the languages I am most confident in , but I also speak a little Russian and Finnish .
My degree course is primarily focused on foreign languages and cultures , anthropology , and linguistics .
I am currently a teacher of Italian to foreigners , but I 've also translated philosophy texts and curricula vitae between Italian and English .
There is no future for public transport in my country ; it is a fact . Services are overcrowded everywhere , pollution is widespread throughout the city , and do n't forget the rising prices of petroleum products ; nowadays traveling by car is more convenient , safer , and cheaper .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you regarding the job vacancy entitled " USA Summer Camps " advertised on the Monster website .
After reading the requirements carefully , I believe I have the necessary skills to apply for this position .
I have ten years of experience working with children as a coach at a tennis club .
I love this profession , and I would like to continue developing my professional career on this project .
I consider myself a very enthusiastic , motivated , and helpful person , and I would love to be part of your company as an instructor for this summer camp .
Currently , I am studying for an MA in Children 's Care because I am interested in developing my professional career in this field .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Domenica Casado
I wake up at 4:00 a.m. every day and start work at 5:30 a.m .
I finish work at 3:30 PM ; after work I need to go to school and finish at 8:45 PM . After I get back home , I take a shower , have a short talk with my boyfriend , and go to bed at 11:00 PM .
Sometimes we watch the film together if I have the day off .
Once a month , we play basketball with friends on the weekend .
Sometimes we go bowling if all our friends are free at night .
" Seven " can be categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie , and people consider it moving and gripping .
The main characters were portrayed by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt . One of the most notable facts was that the film grossed more than €330 million in total when it premiered in 1995 .
It is directed by David Fincher , who also directed The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , and it is a Paramount production .
The film chronicles a series of murders related to the seven deadly sins ( lust , pride , wrath , sloth , envy , greed , and gluttony ) committed by a psychopath who left a mark on each victim to indicate the sin for which they were killed .
This led to an investigation by two policemen who tried to fit all the pieces of the crime together , but it proved more difficult than they expected .
I personally think this film is fast-moving and spine-chilling ; I found it astonishing , but I understand that there is no way it has a happy ending and that some scenes are unpleasant because they involve murder .
If you like mystery films , I strongly recommend it .
I sincerely hope this review convinces the reader to watch the film .
Dear Joe ,
Thank you for your letter .
I 'm very glad you have thought about visiting my country .
I 'm sure you will like it .
I can give you some tips for traveling ; it depends on what you like to do .
If you like museums , galleries , and architecture , I recommend that you visit our beautiful cities , such as Wrocław , Kraków , Poznań , Gdańsk , and , of course , our capital , Warsaw .
On the other hand , if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should consider going to our mountains—the Sudetes or the Carpathians—or to Masuria , which is full of lakes .
You may also combine it .
For example , you might fly to Warsaw , visit the city , then take a trip north , including a visit to our sea — which , unfortunately , is n't the warmest or most beautiful sea in the world .
Honestly , you can skip it without hesitation .
But our lakes are really worth visiting .
There are many ways to spend your free time there .
You can go horse riding , swimming , kite surfing , fishing , etc .
Next , we could meet in Wrocław .
I would show you the city , which I like very much .
Then , I would take you to the mountains .
You may finish your trip in Krakow , and then look for a job there or in Warsaw .
These are our two biggest cities , with many students and many job offers available .
Since you speak very little Polish , the easiest way to find suitable work is to look for an English-speaking company .
I believe Poland is a very good place for you .
The landscape is beautiful , and people are very friendly .
Let me know if you need any more help .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Best regards ,
Ewa
The 20th-century invention that has had one of the most radical effects on people 's lives is the television .
During the 1950s , America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution .
The era of Populuxe instigated a 'must-have ' ideology in the nation , and the most important 'must-have ' was , of course , the television .
The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass culturalization of various groups , the commercialization of our lifestyles , and the rapidity and breadth of the information that reaches us .
Gathered around the tube , the American family learned the 'ideal ' way of life .
But the picture of perfection was the same in every home .
We all received the same information .
We all saw the same families , the Cleavers and the Andersons , etc. , telling us how to behave .
Mother was always beautiful ; father knew best ; the children had cute , silly , harmless problems .
As a result of this comprehensive picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York was like .
People in New York watched Green Acres .
Today the same trend continues .
To white people , ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery .
The examples on television are blown up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
Rather than several small , isolated cultures , the United States is moving toward mass culturalization .
The presence of someone else 's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason .
Another effect of television is the commercialization of people 's lives .
Advertisements , which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , have developed into an art form .
15-second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars , and as a result Americans are made to laugh or cry , and often to buy a product .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , with the advent of television , American citizens have experienced a great increase in the amount of information they receive , as well as in the speed with which it reaches them .
A hundred years ago , different sections of the country ( and the world ) were isolated and separated by the time it took to mail a letter and print a newspaper story .
Today , we know within seconds — or , in the case of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion , live — immediately .
This abundance of information has led to a drastic alteration in people 's ability to react to major events .
Our view of the world is different ; it 's closer ; it 's in our living rooms .
A good example of this is the reaction to the Vietnam War .
The war was indeed unpopular with or without television .
But the reality of what we saw — the casualty counts , the bloody children beneath the American flag — did much to underscore the negative aspects of war .
Overall , television has caused a radical change in our lives .
We are open to manipulation as well as stimulation .
The television is a powerful and dangerous tool .
It can greatly enhance our lives , but it is most important to be aware that it is manipulative .
We must watch what we watch .
I do n't agree with the statement that there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
When you decide to travel by car , you certainly feel independent ; you can stop whenever you need and set off when you 're ready , which is why travelling by car is said to be convenient .
However , there are sometimes more important things than feeling comfortable when travelling , such as money . Travelling by car is expensive , as the price of petrol continues to increase because of limited natural resources .
Although there are some places in the world where car users can not complain about the price of petrol , there are far more areas where people give up driving to commute and instead ride bikes because they can not afford to own a car .
Nowadays we are much more aware of the environment .
Thus , we know that using cars is harmful to the environment . We are advised to take public transport instead of travelling alone because it produces fewer exhaust fumes per passenger .
Moreover , in several countries there is a public transport festival during which people can travel for free and are asked to leave their private cars in the garage .
To sum up , in my opinion , public transport will remain as long as scientists do n't discover new natural sources of petrol or invent a cheap alternative to fuel cars .
We do not care about the overall environment in China ; we only care about the environment in and around our own homes .
We throw all kinds of household waste into the same basket , and the cleaner will collect it .
Sometimes an odor will remain because the basket is indoors .
We do not care about the air , even though air pollution is very serious in some parts of China .
We choose only convenient ways , even if they may have a negative effect on our living environment .
Dear Jo ,
Spain has many beautiful places you ought to see .
I think you should start off in Madrid so we can meet . I 'll show you around .
We 'll visit all the tourist attractions , and you 'll get to try lots of delicious food .
Then you should visit Barcelona ; it 's a truly beautiful city with many must-see places like the Sagrada Família , and you can also go to the beach to relax .
From there , I think you could follow the coast and visit cities such as Valencia , Cartagena , or Málaga during the summer and leave the inland cities for autumn .
As for working here , well , it 's not going to be easy ; we 're having difficulties with that , but I guess you could find a part-time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sending your CV and all that .
And if everything fails , we can always ask my aunt ; she owns a small shop in the city centre , and she 'd be more than happy to have someone help her out .
See you soon
Sam
Hi Jo ,
In my country , there are many opportunities to work and have fun .
Italy is an enormous country full of culture and opportunities .
For example , I live in Jesolo , near Venice , and there are businesses , hotels , and other firms here ; if you want , you can also work as a tour guide .
When traveling , I think the best thing is to start , for example , in the south of Italy and visit all the amazing cities in the country : Florence , Milan , Genoa , Rome , and Venice .
There are also a lot of courses and other activities to do .
You also have many opportunities with universities .
Venice and Padova are the most important cities for learning .
It 's a great idea .
I hope I can see you soon , and that I can be helpful in your decision .
As you may have already noticed , Warsaw is a beautiful , large city .
It was really hard to choose just one place that you must visit .
Obviously , it largely depends on your interests .
If you want to know Warsaw from a historical perspective , I recommend visiting the Old Town .
The Royal Castle .
It would be helpful for you to ask for a guide .
Honestly , I think it is very educational , but a bit boring .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely appreciate something that is less educational but more interesting .
Your must-visit place is the National Stadium .
I 've been there many times , and trust me , there 's a lot to see .
It was built specifically for Euro 2012 .
We were the host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
The first thing that attracts our attention is the interesting architecture .
It looks like a red-and-white basket ; it refers to Poland 's flag .
The stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch , a training pitch , façade lighting , and underground parking .
There is even a railway station opposite the stadium that was built in the same style .
When you get there , you will not be disappointed .
There are guided tours where you will hear the story of the stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
You will also visit the changing rooms where football players prepare for the match .
It is a multipurpose venue able to host not only sporting events but also concerts , cultural events , and conferences .
I really recommend visiting this place .
It would be an unforgettable and fascinating trip .
It would also be a great windfall for all football lovers .
You will not regret that , I promise .
Life could change in the coming years because a new way of life is emerging due to technological advances .
When I look back , I realise teenagers are different ; they are looking for different things in their lives .
For example , when I was young , students used to study for several years to become experts and get good jobs .
Nowadays , teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
Everything around me is changing quickly — education , the way we live , the way we think , and technology — so I think all this will change life in the future .
In fact , I am looking forward to seeing this change , and I hope it will be as good as I expect ; above all , I hope a major change in the health service will be made .
With economic development , a growing number of much-needed buildings are taking the place of farmland , forests , and wetlands .
As far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to citizens and animals than good .
First , the large-scale buildings bring various kinds of pollution .
The construction process produces a large amount of material waste as well as noise , which disturbs the lives of nearby inhabitants .
At the same time , the glass covering the surface of the skyscraper reflects dazzling light .
Besides , the destruction of habitats hastens the extinction of wildlife and reduces species diversity .
If there are no more trees and grass to freshen the air , air pollution will become more serious .
What 's more , building much more housing than is needed is a waste of society 's resources .
To solve those problems , the government should adopt strategies .
First , measures should be taken to protect farmland , forests , and wetlands .
Each city should be guaranteed the minimum area needed for afforestation .
What 's more , the government should encourage investment in environmentally friendly projects instead of housing construction .
The last point is this .
Presents
Regarding a recent radio discussion about the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as luxuries , homemade items , or different life experiences , the matter is open to debate .
On the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time , whether it 's for Christmas , birthdays , or just because you want to show someone how much you care about them .
Experiences are now considered the best kind of gift , as people have finally come to understand the importance of memories in our lives instead of merely collecting luxury items , clothes , or photographs .
Moreover , in my view , besides having the amazing opportunity to receive such a gift , you can also share it with the people you love most .
In addition , I do not find any disadvantage in this type of present .
On the other hand , homemade items are also extremely pleasant to receive .
Not only are they made with love , but they are also generally made from recycled materials , such as glass , plastic , and even wood .
The main advantage is that , as mentioned earlier , the item was probably made with passion .
However , the person who receives the present may not like it at all .
That is the main disadvantage .
These ideas led me to my conclusion : the best presents to receive are experiences , as you will always remember them and can share them with your family and acquaintances .
My teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course , which was based on theories of second language acquisition .
Currently , my beliefs about teaching English focus on the following points : ( i ) children should be familiar with English as early as possible ; ( ii ) the teacher should motivate students so they can achieve their language-learning goals ; ( iii ) the teacher must be a good monitor in class ; and ( iv ) the teacher must interact well with students .
My beliefs help me feel more confident about becoming an English teacher in the future .
First of all , parents should allow their children to start learning English early .
My first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire a second language better than children do .
From reading about child language acquisition in SLA , I learned that childhood is the period during which people acquire a second language most easily ( McLaugh , 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 123 ) .
Moreover , children between the ages of 5 and 9 , often referred to as being in the critical period , can acquire a second language naturally and do not need any special teaching methods .
Children have better phonology than adults , and they display morphological sensitivity that adults do not display .
However , older learners will be successful in acquiring second-language ( L2 ) syntax .
Patkowski ( 1980 ) found that learners who began learning an L2 after puberty had lower proficiency scores than those who began before puberty .
In the future , I will encourage everyone to introduce their children to English as early as possible to help them develop a native-like accent .
If I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities that focus on communication skills and give students opportunities to be exposed to authentic input such as cartoons , music , etc .
Secondly , the teacher should inspire students , raise their awareness of learning , and help them achieve their language-learning goals . When I was in grade ten , I lacked the motivation to learn English because my parents forced me to learn it .
Consequently , my results do not meet the goal my parents expected me to achieve .
After my parents invited a tutor , I passed the class exam with a high mark and became more motivated to learn .
I want to become an English teacher .
Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA , as it helps students succeed in learning an L2 ( Skehan , 1989 , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 426 ) .
Students can spend all their time doing what interests them , and they will never get bored .
The more motivated students are in language learning , the more successful they will be .
It is really a long-term project that allows students to improve their proficiency in a second language .
They need to receive a number of comprehensible inputs and complete many tasks to achieve their goal .
As a teacher , I will make efforts to increase students ' motivation because it changes over time ( Dörnyei and Ottó , 1998 ; detailed in Dörnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p. 428 ) .
Thirdly , a good teacher is one who can organize all the activities in class well .
For instance , when I teach grammar , I have to decide how many structures I can teach in a lesson , and with some difficult grammar rules I need to break them down and teach them in stages .
Learners need time to memorize the new rule and to integrate it into their learning system .
After teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure based on my cue cards .
While they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say it , so I can tell whether they have acquired the rules or are just using their learned knowledge .
Finally , interaction is an interesting theory .
Gass ( 2003 ) found that " language learning is stimulated by the communication of pressure , the relationship between communication and acquisition , and the mechanisms . "
Therefore , I will teach my students only in English , give them more opportunities to communicate with one another through the tasks I assign in class , and move around the classroom to correct their mistakes through negotiation , recasts , or feedback .
When I observe their dialogue , I will note any mistakes and , after they finish their practice , correct them .
I advise interrupting their speech because they are being disrespectful .
In addition , if I always correct their mistakes , my students will lose confidence and will not want to practice anymore .
This is my philosophy on foreign language teaching .
These beliefs help me consider what I will do in the future when I become an English teacher .
This course broadened my knowledge considerably through the theories in the SLA book .
I think that students in the School of Foreign Language Education must take this course to develop a better teaching philosophy .
The aim of this report is to describe how my town protects the environment and what people do to address the issue .
Firstly , I am going to talk about what my town does .
The town is generally clean , thanks to the cleaning services .
Roads are cleaned every night , and rubbish is frequently collected during the day .
Even if the cleaning service is very efficient , people do n't usually take care of the environment .
They throw their wrappers on the ground .
In other words , citizens do n't worry much about where they live .
The town has implemented a programme to solve this problem , offering prizes to those who take action against bad behaviour .
As a result of this new policy , the town is now more attractive and cleaner than it was in the past .
Residents have changed their bad habits and the image of the town has improved .
In conclusion , thanks to the new way of living , tourists are more attracted to and curious about visiting the town , and the town has reduced its cleaning costs .
The amount of money saved is used to build new green areas across the town .
European nations have over time been linked together both in war and in peace .
These countries have since been moving closer together along more institutional lines .
One such demonstration of this has been the formation of the European Community , composed of the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community , and the European Economic Community .
In 1987 , the European Community adopted the Single European Act , under which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal European market by 1992 .
This act has raised questions in Britain about whether it will result in a loss of sovereignty .
The lifting of trade barriers among the member states will enable the free movement of trade .
This economic union will not necessarily result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe .
However , there are fears that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain , since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision-making in the Council of Ministers .
This would restrict individual nations ' ability to veto key decisions .
British sovereignty could be endangered if this union were to lead to a European government imposing its authority over Britain .
A centralised European government would inhibit Britain 's decision-making ability .
The recent incident in which the European Parliament imposed its ideals on Britain highlights the authoritarian principles Britain might be forced to accept if such a strong central body were created .
It was believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns ; however , this action seemed to be an imposition on Britain 's sovereignty , as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do .
If the European Community were to introduce a single currency , Britain could be deprived of its sovereignty , since it would lose its individuality and , more importantly , its bargaining position in foreign exchange .
Currency decisions would be made by a central body that Britain would have to accept .
If a single Europe were to lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe rather than their own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .
It would mean a supranational force fighting as a whole , with no real differences between its members ; it would not be a case of " one force , one nation . "
However , the state would still exist as an island , and people would always feel British because of their roots and history .
Even if linked physically to Europe via the Channel Tunnel , Britain would still see itself as a separate country .
I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based solely on economic free trade between nations .
However , if a strong European government were created that made important decisions for Britain , such as currency settlements and the conduct of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an independent state with the power to make its own decisions and would therefore lose its sovereignty .
The picture shows the process of making notes .
First , design it—that is the most important step ; avoid copying ; then it can be printed when it is finished .
Make sure the quality sheets : if they are bad , they will be destroyed ; if they are good , they will be packaged and distributed .
The sheet describes cutting sheets into separate banknotes , packing , and dispatching .
All of these are the basic processes . What we use is based on them .
Banks should make efforts to ensure security for users . Through this process , we learn about banknotes ; they are essential to our lives , and we use them to buy whatever we need .
This graph shows the amount of petrol used in the United States and the United Kingdom .
As is well known , these countries are among the most powerful in the world .
First , the United States line shows that the poorest socioeconomic class spends the largest percentage of its income .
Secondly , the richest drivers spend less on cars .
However , this patron is not the same as the one at the other place .
In the first place , we can note the percentage of capital spent on gas that is contributed by wealthy people in the United Kingdom .
Secondly , the lowest incomes are reported for British citizens who come from a low socioeconomic background .
Once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom has a similar patron .
According to the richest drivers , both lines are linked at the same place .
Dear summer camp holder ,
Hi !
This is Mimi .
I am an outgoing girl who enjoys getting along with people very much .
A few years ago , I was an elementary school teacher ; I quit such a nice job because of my dream of becoming a nurse , but that became an obstacle to getting along with those cute little angels .
Thus , I have a profound belief in my ability to do this job well .
By the way , I once attended a summer camp while I was in college .
It was a role similar to this job , involving preparing meals and snacks , organizing games and surprising them , and taking good care of them .
Though it may seem that having to do so much will be extremely exhausting for me , both my experience and my instincts tell me that it would be a great time and leave a beautiful memory in my life .
Neither hardship nor frustration could change my decision ; only by trying difficult things could a person improve and find their way in life .
Above all , thank you for giving me the opportunity to show who I am .
It would be my greatest pleasure to be your partner .
I hope you all enjoy a nice day .
Your friend , Mimi
Dear Lionel Messi ,
I 'm writing to persuade you with some information you probably do n't know .
I would like to say that you should give more money to charity , and I think you should be paid much less than you are now .
Firstly , I would like to say that you should be paid much less than you are being paid now .
Because you 're getting paid about £330,000 per week .
So , can you think about doctors and nurses ? They save lives almost every day , and you are not doing anything—just playing football and having fun with your friends .
Therefore , you should be paid about £250 per game .
I think that is a huge amount of money , anyway .
In other words , I think you should give more money to charity because charities need your help .
So , I would say that in the 1960s wages were about £4–£7 per week .
It took about 20 years for that wage limit to double to between £8 and £14 per week in the 1980s .
When I was a kid , I was addicted to reading children 's stories .
When I was a teenager , I read so many teen novels that my mother reproached me for sitting and reading for too long instead of doing my schoolwork .
Luckily , I managed to do both , and I remember studying hard to have a real chance of reading whatever I wanted with my mother 's consent .
Today I realize how reading these stories has made me interested in writing .
I 've always wondered how you come to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
Of course , a good writer must first be a good reader .
This is how I developed my ambition to write .
Reading stories , poems , and novels inspired me to write my own .
Reading what my fellow writers here said about their experiences as writers—what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel—all of that answered my questions .
More than that , I found insights into my own motives and goals as a writer .
I liked Shirley Carreira 's close relationship with her father and his library .
I enjoy being intimate with my books .
I love the way they feel and smell , and I always prefer them to electronic versions .
They make you feel like you are in touch with the magic they offer .
Books draw you in as if by a spell .
Michael is a very popular guy ; he is very intelligent and enjoys going to hear stories about ghosts and strange things .
One day his friend told him to go to a cabin , because strange things were happening there ; he accepted immediately .
On Saturday they were walking around the street looking for the cabin , and they found a very old cabin .
They saw a horrible ghost , and he asked them two questions about his life , but the men said nothing ; furious , the ghost said , " Okay — the second question is : How many years have I lived ? "
Michael was nervous because he did not know anything about it .
The ghost said , " Michael told me that if you want to save your family or your friend , you can only save one ; the other person will die . "
After ten seconds , Michael said , " I saved my family . I 'm sorry , friend , " then closed the door and ran far away , knowing at that moment that he had made a mistake .
Although Louise felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
That was the objective she had been dreaming of for many years .
If I make a decision , there will be no going back . I have to think it over .
She was speaking to herself .
She could let her parents down .
They expected to send her to one of the most prestigious medical universities .
Alas , she was not sure whether they cared about her opinion .
Because she was a humanist , she was not keen on science .
Louise had been given a chance to go abroad .
She did not mind working long hours at entertainment venues or earning little money .
Her spirit longed to leave her country for the United States .
She could not say whether it was a judicious feeling .
Generally , Louise was said to be an indecisive person ; this was especially noticeable in such cases .
The advantages of leaving outweigh the drawbacks .
Her parents did not seem to be over the moon .
The girl convinced them and made them realise that it would not be the end of the world if she chose her own way .
Everyone is afraid of something , but a lot of people are more afraid of catastrophic events than of things like cancer .
Even though people are scared of these things , they continue to smoke and drink alcohol .
Some of our fears are instinctive , so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time to think about it .
Our fear makes us act instinctively ; we react so quickly and save ourselves .
This type of fear is a necessary and life-saving response .
There are different kinds of fear , for example , phobias .
We experience phobias in situations that are not dangerous .
Many people have phobias , but those phobias do n't threaten their lives every day .
Scientists say that phobias , which arise from negative experiences or traumas , are difficult to control but could be prevented with the right therapy .
We know what fear is thanks to experience and culture .
We are born with small , basic fears , but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . Stories on TV , the internet , and in newspapers increase the perceived risk of extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry about things that will never happen to us .
To better enjoy our lives without being oppressed by our fears , we must be objective when we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
International Sports Monthly : Swimming
When I was younger , I used to swim , and it is my favourite sport now .
When I am swimming , I like the sensation of flowing through the water .
My advice would be to enjoy the water .
Enjoy your time swimming !
When you start swimming , you learn a lot of new techniques ; it 's like discovering a new world . I do n't swim to participate in competitions ; I swim to have fun .
The continual development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times .
Nowadays , computers are widely used in all parts of society .
One area that has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .
Since the early 1980s , when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into millions of homes , there has been controversy over their effect on children .
There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child 's ability to learn .
The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the Amiga and the PC , has served to deepen the " problem . "
The growing realism of the games appeals strongly to children .
However , parents feel that children should broaden their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is discouraging them from learning .
Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children , a belief accentuated by surveys showing that the vast majority are unable to do simple arithmetic mentally and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
Another moral dilemma posed by computers is their role in the workplace .
Many people fear that computers will eventually replace humans in the workplace .
Computers already play a significant role in employment areas such as accountancy , which requires specialized skills in calculating and manipulating numbers .
These computers have replaced humans , and such changes have sparked fears that unemployment could increase dramatically .
Since computers are more efficient than humans , require no payment for their work , are less temperamental , and will never take a day off due to illness , humanity faces a great problem .
Another claim that suggests the human brain could become useless is that computers promote antisocial behaviour .
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet has raised concerns that the human race will become unsociable .
The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world , and it also contains many other functions that supposedly make life easier for us .
According to many , the Internet also has another fundamental problem .
There is a belief that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will remove life 's challenges .
The human brain constantly needs to be challenged to maintain itself , but with the introduction of the Internet , one could conduct one 's life without ever leaving the house , which many believe would threaten society .
However , at the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans .
No matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may demonstrate , it still relies on the human brain to program it and put it into operation .
Although there are plans to create computers that can programme themselves ( which I personally feel is a very dangerous idea ) , humans still very much control computers and still have the ability to end their existence at any given moment , a power computers do not have .
Since I have been studying in Australia , I have realised that there is a significant difference in how English is studied compared with China .
Traditionally , Chinese teachers adopted cramming methods and paid attention to grammar and vocabulary .
By comparison , the English Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me with more opportunities to interact and converse with classmates .
After studying for the EAP , I have found that time management is my weakness .
Therefore , I will read related resources to learn more about study strategies .
Time management is a crucial factor for productive learning .
As the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) describes , time management can be achieved by making a daily planner ( p. 23 ) .
So I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .
Doing this helps me complete my daily tasks more efficiently .
Secondly , Mark 's ( 2006 , p. 25 ) research states that scattered time during the day should be used more productively .
For instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train or actively participated in conversations during my breaks .
I have learned that small bits of time , added together , can be used very productively .
In conclusion , by researching and comparing study strategies , I discovered that time management is crucial to achieving productive learning .
However , to become better learners , students must also stay focused and motivated .
In my future studies , in addition to spending my time more productively , I will also set manageable short-term goals and review my plans regularly based on my study targets .
Hello , my name is Xiawu Kam . I am nine years old this year . Today I am going to write about my favourite sport . My favourite sport is basketball because it helps me keep fit and is fun .
I started playing basketball in grade one , and now I am in grade four . That means I have been playing for three years ! My dad likes to play basketball too !
You know , I really enjoy this sport because it is very exciting !
If someone asks me which sport is the best , I will tell him or her that basketball is the best .
I really like basketball , and the teacher told me I was really , really good at it , so I always play basketball when I have free time .
I am on my school 's junior basketball team .
I hope that this year I can join the older students ' basketball team at school !
I hope you can play sports as I do , because playing them is really healthy for everyone .
Thank you !
Thanks again for reading my article . Goodbye !
Hi Mary ,
How 's your life ? Mine has changed a lot since the last time we were in touch .
As I told you , new people have come to the office .
We have established a wonderful relationship , especially with one of them .
He is very outgoing and very friendly .
He has a fantastic sense of humor , and he always makes me laugh , so I can forget the bad times .
He is very polite , generous , and honest .
At work he is a creative person ; as you know , this is very important in our job . He always has an idea when others ca n't think of anything .
However , he can be a bit immature at times .
He is very keen on sports ; his favourite sport , like mine , is basketball .
It 's a pleasure to be with him , and I really enjoy his company .
I think we fit well ; we have many things in common and almost the same likes and dislikes .
He is a talkative person ; I 'm not . As you know , I am a bit shy .
But I do n't think it will be a problem .
I must leave now ; it 's time to work .
Love
Krashen 's theory is one of the best-known and most influential language acquisition theories of the 1970s .
Krashen presented this theory over several years in his works .
It was presented in his seminal work The Input Hypothesis : Issues and Implications ( 1985 ) , and it can be summarized in the following hypothesis :
• the Acquisition-Learning hypothesis ,
• the Monitor Hypothesis .
The Natural Order hypothesis .
• the input hypothesis
The Affective Filter hypothesis .
The acquisition-learning hypothesis is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypotheses presented here .
It states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language .
On the one hand , acquisition is , according to Krashen , the unconscious process children undergo from birth to develop their first-language ability .
Language learners are not usually aware that they are acquiring the language .
They are not aware of the rules . They speak without thinking , believe what they say is correct , and do not stop to consider the mistakes they make because they do not think they are doing anything wrong .
Some things sound good , and others do not .
On the other hand , we have the learning process , which involves the development of competence in a second language .
We use the term " learning " to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of a second language , for example being aware of its rules .
Some theorists say that children acquire language , but adults can not ; they just learn .
But according to Krashen , the acquisition–learning process says that adults can also acquire languages ; the ability to pick them up does not disappear when we grow up .
But at the same time , this does not mean that adults can always achieve native-like language levels or have access to the same natural " language acquisition device " that children use , because it is so different .
Acquisition is a powerful process for adults .
Acquisition can not be converted into learning , and vice versa .
There are two different processes ; acquisition is the most important one because we must first master the mother tongue and only after that learn additional languages .
According to this theory , an application for teaching could be that the optimal way to learn a language is through natural communication .
For a second-language teacher , the best thing is to create situations where the language is used to fulfil authentic purposes .
This will help students , children , or adults acquire the language instead of learning it .
Sport makes you test your limits .
You need to get ambitious , improve , and convince .
For me , it 's simply passion .
I 've loved basketball forever .
Whether I followed professionals on TV or watched students on the school basketball court , I was always instantly fascinated .
When I was seven years old , my father used to motivate me .
If I scored ten times in a row from the same spot , he would take me to the kiosk and let me choose as many sweets as I could eat .
Of course I could n't make it .
But I did n't give up .
After many weeks , hours of training , and countless frustrating moments , my precision improved .
My father was stunned .
He could n't believe that a young boy like me could score so many points .
The following day , I was rewarded with the promised sweets .
Even after ten years , my motivation had n't changed .
1 . The scarlet letter box is one of the most recognizable symbols of England .
There is no doubt that most young people want to be white-collar workers .
3 . All my neighbors want to vote for the Greens .
4 . I saw an amazing crimson sunset yesterday .
5 .
He spent his holidays near the turquoise sea .
6 .
My friend opposed the Reds , and that was one of the reasons he left his country .
7 .
She is feeling blue because she lost her job .
8 .
The honey I bought at the market near my home has an amber tint .
10 . That old lady looks a bit green .
Introduction
First of all , this report is concerned with how to spend your shopping time in Albacete .
Albacete is easy to walk around , and in the city center you can find most of the shops .
Suggestions
In the commercial zone , you can find two small shopping centers .
All of them have the main street between them , and one is in front of the other .
These two are not very big ; however , there are two or three small shops that are really original .
In contrast , I would mention two big shopping centers in my city .
All of them are on the outskirts , and there are :
Eroski is where you can find many different shops .
Most of them are in the city center , too .
El Corte Inglés is where you can buy many different brands on its five floors .
Conclusion
From my point of view , the city center is more attractive than the shopping centers .
It 's a little stressful for me ; in contrast , I prefer a relaxing walk , looking at shop windows , to an indoor shopping center .
But it depends on how much of a shopping addict you are .
Hi , Dan .
Thank you for your letter .
How are things ?
I am fine .
Would you mind going with me this Saturday ?
This Saturday is Mum 's birthday .
Yesterday I bought her a new television , although she has an old one that is horrible .
This evening I am inviting her to the cinema .
We are watching Spider-Man , and afterward we 're going to Burger King because she likes it ; I do n't like it , but there 's no accounting for taste .
Transport is an important activity in any country .
The advent of technology has brought about drastic changes in transportation over time .
At the same time , transport has become a very important means of development for any nation , as all nations are moving towards globalization .
Public transportation has played a very important role in moving people from one place to another .
The bulk production and marketing of cars have been reducing the role of public transportation .
Cars have become accessible to everyone .
People have preferred cars to public transportation .
This trend is very dangerous for the world .
This would increase air pollution .
The burning of fossil fuels would increase , and this would increase air pollution .
Public transportation should be more attractive and cost-effective .
Governments should encourage people to use public transportation .
People should prefer public transport to private vehicles .
The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE , or , as it is so-called , " Mad Cow Disease . "
It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans through consumption of infected beef .
Beef production is a fairly large business in the U.K. , and it was necessary to learn more about this relatively new disease .
It was discovered that British farmers were to blame because of their various industrial techniques .
The disease was originally carried by chickens .
When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat , the remains ( bones and organs ) were processed to provide a cheap feed product .
Unfortunately , the disease-carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but also to cows .
The cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) , and this was when BSE first emerged .
The correct thing to do would have been to destroy the infected cows , bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation .
However , the farmers had money invested and did not want to back out .
When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef , their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle , spreading the disease further .
Unfortunately , unlike chickens , the cattle were able to pass this disease to humans through their beef .
The same industrial techniques are still used today , and as people in the UK have become aware of the facts and more health-conscious , beef sales have decreased .
It may be up to seven years before you learn that you have contracted the disease .
And so , some members of the public ask , " Why should I stop eating beef if I might already have BSE ? "
Another public attitude is to ignore warnings because there have been no victims .
But it seems that the most popular option is to play it safe and quit beef entirely .
It seems that more and more families have opted for chicken , pork , or lamb as alternatives .
It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well .
If there comes a point where supply exceeds demand , farmers will produce less beef and make less money .
It is therefore conceivable that farmers will switch from beef to an alternative product .
The doorbell rang while I was at home , thinking about my lost little cat .
If you knew my pet cat , you would n't be surprised by my love for him .
His name was Timoshka , and he was n't as ordinary as other cats .
He was very intelligent and could understand my words .
He always knew my voice and my mood .
If I remember correctly , I found him sitting in the street next to my house .
He was so dirty that I could n't see him in the dark .
Only his green eyes were shining there .
I took pity on him and took him into my home .
After his bath , he looked like a white kitten , a snowball .
Well , I went to the door and opened it .
There was a little girl who lived near me .
She was holding something small and dirty .
To my great surprise , it was a cat !
This cat was mine !
How happy I was !
The issue of environmental conservation and pollution prevention is of great concern not only in my city but throughout the country .
Many people are concerned about the increase in production waste , garbage on the streets , and the lack of effective waste processing .
Nowadays we still use traditional methods of recycling and rubbish collection .
One crucial point is that we do not have a system for sorting rubbish by type .
We collect our waste in a single bag and then throw it into the special containers placed in each area of the city .
From time to time , approximately twice a week , this rubbish is loaded into vehicles and taken to the recycling site .
It is difficult to imagine its further processing , but we know for certain that plastic and rubber waste are recycled .
Regarding other items , I think they could be placed in containers and buried underground for preservation .
However , few steps have been taken in this direction by our officials : a new recycling factory was built in a suburb and began operating last year .
On the other hand , many citizens complain about the shortage of garbage baskets and containers on the streets of our city .
Sometimes we may see scenes where someone throws litter directly onto an embankment or sidewalk in the city center , polluting the streets .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
Right after Anna got to work , she , nothing more than a typically underestimated office worker , was told to go see her boss and prepare to be eaten alive because of the last report .
Once she set foot in his office , she was surprised by a crowd of people yelling , " Happy birthday ! "
Literally everybody was there , even her husband , Adam , who was holding their disabled daughter in his arms .
" I 've got a real stunner for you , Anna , " said her boss , smiling like a Cheshire cat .
Because of my upcoming retirement , I was ordered to find my replacement .
I told the management that you were the perfect choice .
Anna was thrilled to bits—after all these years , she was going to become a manager !
And yet another surprise was about to happen .
Her skirt was being pulled out of the blue—Anna looked down and noticed her five-year-old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
It was truly astonishing !
She fell to her knees , tears of joy running down her cheeks .
She felt like she was on cloud nine .
Suddenly , her whole body began to shake .
Adam stood by his wife 's hospital bed , staring at her convulsions .
After many long years in a deep coma , Anna 's family finally lost hope and chose euthanasia with heavy hearts .
The teenage daughter stifled a shriek and buried her head in Adam 's chest .
The shaking stopped , and the long , monotonous sound confirmed that Anna had just left this world for a better place .
Now she could always celebrate her birthday with her beloved family .
I must say , I strongly agree that shopping is not always an enjoyable experience .
To begin with , standing in a queue can get you a terrible headache .
Only ten minutes is just enough in an atmosphere of people shouting and haggling over every last penny .
Every once in a while , when you get home after shopping , you find that you 've bought a pig in a poke .
The food might not be fresh , especially dairy and meat products .
Not only can people not afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too much money on useless goods .
It appears that the shop policy is very relevant in this particular matter .
It 's common to put products on special offer and hire some good-looking salespeople , so it 's almost impossible to refuse them .
As they say , you can shop till you drop !
On the other hand , it 's not necessary to purchase anything at all .
People are shopping around these days to compare prices , are n't they ?
It 's funny , but they always seem to be in search of the biggest bargain in their lives .
There is no doubt that browsing at the mall without buying can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
Introduction to a paper .
The supply chain involves management and information provision across many areas of a company ; it covers everything from the selection of raw materials and their processing into finished goods to the transportation of those finished goods to end customers .
The main parts are suppliers , production , and distribution .
One important task is to provide information in each area to create a logical connection between these main parts in order to achieve the objective of selling a high-quality product while reducing costs and time .
The definition of a standardized process is the establishment of the same method to be applied in the execution of certain activities or functions .
This method is already accepted with the required parameters .
A standardized product is the result of a standardized process .
For example , the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca-Cola bottle in Australia .
A standardized product must not have significant deviations in order to be sold to all customers .
Transport essentially refers to our movement .
Cars are n't always affordable for all sections of society .
Public transport should be operated optimally in accordance with demand .
Public spending should be used appropriately to ensure the greatest benefit to the public .
Drive down any street in urban America , and you will see young men and women , both Black and White , driving Pathfinders , BMWs , Mercedeses , and other luxury automobiles .
How do these young people afford such expensive rides ?
They wear Karl Kani , Pelle Pelle , and Guess clothing .
They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike footwear .
Where do the funds to purchase these fashions come from ?
In many cases , the answer is simple : crime .
As unfortunate as it may sound , many young people are well aware that crime pays , and it pays well .
What alternative does an inner-city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty ?
The answer becomes apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals who live larger than those who take a more " conservative " path to financial security .
The philosophy is simple : if you want it , go get it—at any cost .
The consequences are few , especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail .
The only danger that exists for a criminal comes from other criminals trying to take what 's theirs .
The police are no threat , as they are far outnumbered ; it is virtually a game of chance whether one gets caught committing a crime .
Fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . The public calls for more police but refuses to pay the taxes needed to hire them .
The few police officers on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like dogs chasing their tails .
If a criminal is apprehended and , in the unusual circumstance , placed in jail for a nonviolent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable living supported by burglary , mugging , dealing , or simple con games .
Jail space is reserved for murderers and rapists first , as it should be , but when a murderer is convicted and sentenced , a dealer is put back on the street .
What an ordinary citizen imagines when they witness or hear about a nonviolent crime is a thug bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as they can get their hands on , etc .
In reality , these criminals are merely doing a job that pays them better than any other .
Why work at McDonald 's , where you are forced to work in a hot , cramped atmosphere , possibly with an overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no end in sight , making $ 5.00 an hour and shopping at Kmart for clothes ?
It is obvious that crime pays .
The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and stuffing wads of money into their designer jeans .
This is less a choice than an act of seizing an opportunity .
There are few alternatives for low-income youths , and more obstacles in the quest for cash .
With violent crime rising and financial support for increased policing falling , crime will continue to pay .
If you are looking for a film about teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend that you watch Endless Love .
This is a remake of the 1981 film by Franco Zeffirelli , but instead of an age difference , there is a class difference .
Directed by Shana Feste , the film shows the throes of teenage first love when David , the smart , decent , blue-collar guy who is happy to go into business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with Jade , a wealthy , sheltered , and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University .
The class difference between their families becomes a significant issue for both .
The film features Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the lead roles .
With his handsome face and gentlemanly attitude , and her perfect silhouette , they both try to live together despite their different lifestyles .
They will fight against everything to protect their innocent love .
Both play their parts perfectly , but there are brilliant performances from the rest of the cast as well .
Another thing you 'll love about this movie is the cinematography .
The romantic scenes and the music produce the perfect atmosphere for this type of film .
Finally , the script is wonderful , lovely , and touching , as it should be for David and Jade .
If you enjoy cheesy love movies , I definitely recommend that you watch Endless Love .
It is undeniable that housing and transport networks are very important to us , but many people choose to build them on farmland , in forests , and in wetlands , destroying animals ' habitats and polluting the environment we live in .
In my opinion , it is time for governments to take action .
To begin with , the world 's energy is limited ; in other words , what we eat and what we need depends on farming and forests . If we run out of resources and continue building more large-scale buildings , there will be a disaster .
As for the animals , large-scale construction has destroyed their habitats , so they can no longer live in the forest and have had to move elsewhere . According to China Daily , three elephants came into a town and ate crops because roads were built through their habitat . Many kinds of animals have had to change their living habits to adapt to what people have done .
Many visiting boats enter the sea and pollute the ocean , causing a high death rate among marine species .
To solve these intractable problems , governments need to take measures .
For example , education is the key to fostering people 's responsibility . Governments can teach through public media . They can also enable organizations to travel around the world to address problems in areas that have been devastated . These are perhaps long-term solutions , but they are more realistic than setting up yet another international organization .
Television is one of the greatest inventions of all time .
The invention that swept the world and changed leisure habits for countless millions was pioneered by Scottish-born electrical engineer John Logie Baird .
It had been realised for some time that light could be converted into electrical impulses , enabling those impulses to be transmitted over a distance and reconverted into light .
And now it has become one of the most important forms of mass media .
Millions of people all over the world like to watch TV in their spare time .
It informs , educates and entertains them .
It influences the way people look at the world and causes them to change their views .
TV simply helps us relax after a hard day 's work by providing a great variety of entertaining and musical programs .
However , some people believe that television does a lot of harm .
People are beginning to forget how to occupy themselves in their free time .
It prevents them from communicating with each other or from visiting friends or relatives .
And indeed , people used to have hobbies ; they used to go out for amusements at the theatres , cinemas , and sporting events .
They used to read books and listen to music .
Now all of my free time is devoted to television .
Still , it 's not good for children to be glued to the TV screen all day .
It 's very harmful to their health and to their developing personalities because children prefer low-quality hits , horror films , or banal serials .
I 'm not a very passionate TV viewer .
In fact , I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful .
I relax when I watch musical shows , humorous programs , and TV game shows .
To my mind , all these things depend on people 's lifestyles .
Nevertheless , television has obviously changed society , and it is probably used more than any other form of mass media .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
U.S. Summer Camps
I am writing with regard to your recent advertisement for U.S. summer camps .
I am interested in applying to work for you .
I am 22 years old and have a bachelor 's degree in education from the University of Warmia and Mazury .
My first language is Polish ; however , I am fluent in English , which helps me communicate with children .
I am also very sociable and good at communicating with children of all ages , so I am sure I will be able to establish good relationships with them .
In addition , I have first aid training , which can be very useful in this kind of camp .
As a teacher , I have a lot of experience organizing sports activities , since I used to do similar work .
I am very knowledgeable about children and what they like to do in their free time .
I am confident that I can help these children spend their time actively .
However , I am good at cooking as well . I can help you with cooking if you need any help .
I am very knowledgeable about healthy foods , which I often prepare at home .
I would be more than happy if you chose me for this job , as I am certain I could make a valuable contribution to your summer camps .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Antonina Chludzinska
My name is Caro Gutierrez , and I 'm from Mexico . I am the type of person who likes being around children and helping them with their needs to make things easier for them .
On the other hand , I can participate in various sports , such as swimming , basketball , volleyball , and softball .
I like to work in a clean and organized kitchen .
I also like to have all the required kitchen tools and the ingredients needed to prepare a meal on hand .
I would enjoy working at this summer camp if you give me the opportunity , and I look forward to hearing from you .
Dance your problems away .
Dancing has been my favourite sport since I was very small .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move my body , and perhaps without them I would n't be in a street dance crew right now , taking ballet lessons .
Does n't it just make everyone feel positive about dancing ?
Throughout history , dancing has become easier , and anyone can learn it .
Recent studies show that when you feel down or are having problems , this sport stimulates your senses and has a significant impact on your body and nervous system .
Recent additions include healthy living , which impacts your lifestyle .
It is a highly popular sport ; furthermore , it provides many benefits .
Why not think about it ?
You 'll find that every time a fast song comes on , you 'll need to move even though you 're sitting in a chair .
Instead of sitting down , you should take on the actual challenge and have fun .
Dancing is not intended for any particular age group , so anyone can start .
The only advice would be to clear away the negative mood in your head , forget about the setbacks , and just wind down .
As long as you enjoy yourself , you 'll do well .
In conclusion , if you want a different kind of experience , go out and try it .
Family is the most valuable gift anyone can have .
Having a family means having everything .
The strong and special bond we have with our family is unbreakable ; it is that one powerful and magical connection that lasts forever .
Friends come and go , but your family will always be there for you .
When you 're at your worst , friends leave ; they become strangers overnight , and the next day they do n't even bother to say hello .
We will never know for sure how many of our friends are real and how many only fake a friendship , but there is one thing we can be sure of : our family is our best friend .
Friends ca n't always be relied on ; they are willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
But you can count on your family 's full support whenever you need it .
The family is where we grew up , where we were taught what love and kindness mean , and the treasure that provides us with the warmth of a home .
We 'll never ask a stranger for help ; we 'll ask our mother or grandmother for her wise advice because it is a thousand times more valuable .
I believe that the infinite love our family has for us is the most significant proof that we could never find a better friend than our family anywhere in the world , because since the day of our birth we have been lucky enough to be given the best : our irreplaceable family .
A lot of teenagers are jealous of famous people , assuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy , and fun .
But what about the price they have to pay for their extravagant lifestyle ?
No doubt , young people are sure that celebrities enjoy a life that most of them can only dream of .
At the same time , they forget a very important thing .
Film and pop stars , politicians , and models are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
Moreover , hundreds of fans and paparazzi are pursuing them and sometimes even invade their privacy .
Being in public is the main part of their profession .
On the other hand , they have families of their own and close relatives , and the right to their own pastimes .
In my opinion , famous people deserve admiration for their abilities and talents , though we should not only adore them but also respect them .
Much occurred in the 20th century that changed the way people live .
The most influential invention that comes to mind is the computer .
This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work .
The first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations per second .
With advances in technology and the move toward miniaturization , desktop PCs have evolved .
These small , relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their predecessors did and much more .
Every day , new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools .
The impact of computers on the world has been great .
They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered how data and information are handled .
In short , the productivity of people has increased tenfold .
As we move into the 21st century , this fact will become more important .
The amount of information available in the world will require computers to organize and extract what is of interest .
The personal computer has played , and will continue to play , a major role in our lives .
The day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have a PC of their own , linked by cellular modem to the world 's databases , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will replace the printed page .
We have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th-century miracle .
We are limited only by our imaginations .
And the future of this invention looks bright indeed .
The Cherepovets match factory " FESKO " is the leading company in the match industry .
It is the largest manufacturer of matches in the post-Soviet space and Europe .
At the same time , the company continues to grow , increasing production and strengthening its position in the market .
The first attempt to build the Cherepovetsk Match Factory took place in 1948 , when construction of the factory on the banks of the Yagorba River began .
But a set of equipment for the production of matches was not received .
The building was converted into a pipe and plywood plant .
The match factory was built in 1970 .
It was planned to buy equipment for production in Sweden , but the factory was ultimately equipped with domestic positional equipment .
Then the Cherepovetsk factory 's capacity was almost the worst in the industry .
The company 's general reconstruction began in 1981 .
Five Arenko automatic production lines were installed over three years , and by the end of the technological modernization 70 % of the equipment had been replaced with brand-new units .
It was the beginning of the ascent to a leading position in the industry .
Since 2012 , " FESKO " has been carrying out a large-scale modernization that has cost more than 200 million rubles .
Fitness .
I would like to write about fitness because it 's a topic that interests me , as I live in a family where no one ever stops .
We usually go jogging ; it 's very healthy because a person 's heart rate can improve if they run consistently at a slow pace .
But I know that jogging is a sport that many people hate because it 's tiring , so luckily there are many other sports and each of us can choose the best one for ourselves .
I find aerobics very useful because it combines physical exercise with music ; it 's a lot of fun .
Unfortunately , most people do n't take physical exercise seriously because they are lazy . I think exercise should be an integral part of our lives .
Obviously , fitness also depends on diet .
The healthier you eat , the fitter you are .
That 's good advice , but no one , including me , can give up sweets .
Normally , people go to the gym to feel and look better .
When you feel good about yourself , you enjoy life more and even have greater protection against illness .
In fact , it 's for this reason that I extend the hours of physical education at school .
Sport helps not only the body but also the mind ; it helps to vent nervous energy and makes you feel free .
Do it for yourself ; at the beginning it will be hard , but in the end you 'll be satisfied .
During my time as a teacher , I used to organise many group activities .
An example I would like to provide is from my induction year , when I had to select and organise a group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
When selecting the group , I had to take into account each student 's background and motivations to ensure a mixed , cooperative learning environment .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessary to accomplish the task and to deliver instructional materials .
I used plenty of positive reinforcement to encourage everyone to participate because they were a low-ability group with low motivation and were not used to winning any challenges .
While the students were producing artwork to sell to raise funds , I supervised and monitored their work , giving feedback on completed pieces and how they could improve them .
The campaign was a success , and the group was awarded the prize for showing the greatest solidarity nationwide .
To begin with , everybody has a right to their own privacy .
There is no doubt that no one wants to be stalked ; it is uncomfortable and annoying .
Even a star wants to have a little piece of quiet from time to time .
Surely journalists or paparazzi can be wrong in making their judgments .
It does n't matter whether someone is a celebrity or an ordinary person—I believe misleading gossip can ruin anyone 's life .
On the other hand , sometimes big stars would n't be so famous if they were n't chased by paparazzi .
As a matter of fact , it appears that some people want to be followed intentionally—to gain more fame , of course .
A bad reputation often seems to be the quickest way to bask in glory .
Also , journalists deserve to earn a living and write good stories for their editors , especially if it 's an exclusive about a major event .
Finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price to pay for staying in the limelight .
Famous people are forced to live with it whether they like it or not .
I agree that celebrities should n't be constantly followed by journalists , but if they truly wanted their privacy to be respected , they would n't be involved in so many public scandals ; there are people who just love getting attention .
The diagram exhibits the changes in the number of immigrants to Australia over the last ten years .
It is divided into nine world regions .
The ones that show a significant decrease are Europe and Asia .
Moreover , India , the East , and America experienced only a very small decrease .
However , the regions of Oceania and Africa increased significantly .
Overall , the chart shows that there has been a decrease in immigration .
Nowadays , many famous people face a lack of privacy . In my opinion , they deserve as much privacy as possible .
They are ordinary people with the same needs as everybody else .
However , as they are famous , they receive a lot more attention from the media and fans than we could imagine .
A vast , unstoppable amount of attention is usually more harmful than beneficial .
Everybody wishes to have as much privacy as possible .
It is unbearable for famous people to deal with journalists when they go shopping or anywhere else .
Can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists take a picture of every step you take ?
I can guarantee that none of us would appreciate a lifestyle like that .
I can say firmly that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Students finish school at the age of 16 .
They are very young , but I believe they should have the chance to go their own way .
In my opinion , leaving school at the age of 16 is a good experience for young people because they
Have the chance to gain practical experience .
People tend to look on the bright side .
I think there are two good reasons for going to work at the age of 16 .
Firstly .
Some students are glad to finish studying because they are young and motivated .
Secondly , it is important to learn as much as you can while you are young .
On the other hand , they are not old enough to know what they want to do for their whole lives .
I think it is hard to prepare for real life .
Teachers do their best
But is it enough ?
However , the system is working , and it would be difficult to improve it .
Everybody has the opportunity to make their own decision .
Nowadays , more and more people are adopting a healthy lifestyle .
Everybody wants to be healthy and visit their doctor only once a year for a health evaluation .
However , living a healthy lifestyle is not easy ; it requires the following steps : eating a healthy diet , exercising regularly , and getting enough sleep .
Physical activity is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle .
Regular exercise not only keeps your body physically strong but also reduces the likelihood of developing many health-related problems and increases your tolerance for stressful situations .
It is a fact that physical exercise strengthens our musculoskeletal system .
Well-developed , strong vertebral muscles keep the body in an upright position , preventing vertebral deformation and back pain .
Indeed , doing a type of gym exercise called cardio improves blood circulation to the internal organs and the heart .
Accordingly , the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases .
Also , everybody knows that , due to certain hormonal reactions , strong positive or negative emotions have an impact on heart function .
In a regular person , heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically and even cause a stroke or a heart attack .
In trained people , the intensity of heart contractions and stroke volume increase .
The heart rate will change slightly .
Thus , trained people have a better tolerance for stressful situations .
The food we consume is an important part of a healthy lifestyle .
A healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , unprocessed foods with an appropriate number of calories .
Our daily diet should include adequate amounts of protein , carbohydrates , fats , minerals , and vitamins required for normal bodily functions .
For instance , lack of protein causes muscle weakness ; lack of vitamin A causes myopia and night blindness .
Also , if food is not fresh or is not prepared properly , it can contain bacteria or parasites .
For example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastrointestinal tract dysfunctions , and seafood that has not been properly thermally processed can cause leptospirosis .
Moreover , fast food should not be on the table .
By avoiding fast-food products , we reduce the risk of developing some serious diseases , such as cancer .
French fries are only one example .
Fries are usually cooked in a large amount of oil that is kept boiling all day .
According to science , we have to limit portion sizes and consume only the number of calories required by our individual needs .
In this way , we will never have problems with obesity .
Being healthy is fun !
You may think being unhealthy means being fat , but that 's not true .
Being unhealthy can lead to multiple diseases , such as heart disease , respiratory problems , and even depression .
Besides this being very awful , staying healthy is a good way to feel good about yourself , find new interests , and make new friends .
Here are some suggestions for those who want to be healthy :
Instead of going to a fast-food chain at lunchtime , why do n't you try our campus cafeteria , which has a wide variety of salads and soups that are not only healthy but also really tasty ?
Did you know that our athletics team is accepting registrations ?
This could be a great way to find new teammates who would help you develop some skills .
Do n't waste time ; run to get the last spots .
Right outside our campus , you can find a gym that offers many activities , such as spinning , aerobics , and even swimming lessons .
Also , because you are studying at this college , they will give you a big discount !
Are you what is called a couch potato ? Get up from the couch , turn off the TV , and go to the park on campus .
There , you can breathe some fresh air while you read a book , play Frisbee , or defend your point of view with other students .
Traveling by car has become increasingly popular .
However , public transport will still survive .
First of all , public transport , such as buses and subways , is much cheaper and more resource-efficient than cars .
Public transport can provide an affordable option for those who can not afford to buy fancy cars .
It 's more convenient to travel long distances by public transportation , such as by plane , since driving can be exhausting and inconvenient .
Last but not least , public transport is more environmentally friendly than cars , which means it will play an even more important role as environmental problems become increasingly severe .
If I could dream of an imaginary vehicle , it would be long , wide , and white .
I must be lying in it to travel , and the most important thing is that I 'll fall completely asleep in a few seconds .
I will be awake again when I arrive at my destination : the Spanish Golden Century .
There , the dramatist Lope de Vega will be waiting to show me how plays were staged in that period , when the theatre was the best entertainment and the buildings were magnificent .
Maybe I 'll act like I did in the past .
Now I 'm going to write a movie review .
The name of the film is Bangalore Days .
It is a film by Anjali Menon , who previously directed Ustad Hotel .
It is a tale of three childhood friends from Kerala .
Kuttan , Kunju ( Diviya ) , and Arjun .
They are typical young people from small towns dreaming of the big city Bangalore .
Kuttan himself narrates the story .
He starts with a punchline : when they are in Kerala , they do n't like it , but when they are outside Kerala , they miss it so much .
At the beginning of the story , Kuttan got a job in Bangalore , and Divya completed her BBA at a local college .
She is planning to go to a bigger city to pursue an MBA .
At that moment , an astrologer recommended that Divya marry soon .
So an arranged marriage happened .
Her husband 's name is Das .
When Das first met Divya , he told her that he had been in a serious relationship and did n't think he was over it .
But it did not harm the marriage .
From the first night of their marriage , Divya felt that something was very wrong when Das took off his wedding clothes , appeared in a sleeping gown carrying a laptop , and said he had some office work to do .
When they went to their apartment in Bangalore to see a room , Das said the room was locked and filled with old stuff , so they could use the other rooms .
He keeps himself busy with office work all the time ; besides , he behaves as if he has no time for others .
Although Divya and he are a married couple , he has never shown any interest in her .
In the beginning , Divya always tried to match Das , but she could not .
So she is losing patience and adopting a don't-care attitude .
Dad never feels sorry for Divya .
So she keeps herself busy with her friends .
Meanwhile , Arjun came to the city . As a motorcycle expert , he found a racing club called the Storm Riders and started working as a motorcycle mechanic .
Because he can ride a motorbike exceptionally well , he won a race against the club owner .
Later , the club owner banned him for one year .
But the club 's coach keeps an eye on him .
Meanwhile , Arjun falls in love with an RJ named Sarah , who is disabled .
The relationship faces long odds .
Sarah 's mother does n't approve of the relationship .
They want to go to Australia .
The relationship between Divya and Das is getting worse .
At that time , after a quarrel , Divya opened the locked room and found that it contained keepsakes from Das 's past relationship .
Now Divya understands why her relationship is not working .
Then she discussed it with her two best friends , Arjun and Kutty .
These two became very angry .
Later , Divya goes back to her parents ' home .
Her family blamed Das and his family and wanted a divorce .
Kuttan wants to marry a girl who is a traditional Malayali , respects Kerala 's culture , and is beautiful .
At this point , Kuttan took an urgent flight to visit his sick father .
On the plane , he met Meenakshi , the flight attendant .
When Kuttan saw Meenakshi , he thought he had found his dream girl .
Later , they suddenly met in a mall and exchanged phone numbers .
The relationship began to grow .
Later he found that Meenakshi was not a traditional girl but rather a trickster .
It broke his heart .
Eventually , he found Indian traditionalism in a foreign girl .
One day , when the yearly racing event comes around , the coach tries to persuade Arjun to attend .
At this time , Arjun found out that Das was the racing legend of the club .
Everybody respects and loves Das .
He learns the story of Das from others .
After a terrible accident , Das 's girlfriend died .
After that , no one saw Das . Arjun shared the thing with his friends .
Divya immediately returned to Bangalore and started her MBA .
Now Das and Divya are coming closer .
In the race , Arjun becomes the champion .
On the same day , Sarah is leaving for Australia .
After the race , Dad drove them to Sarah 's home to halt her .
Thus , the story ended happily .
I love playing tennis .
I think it is one of the most complete sports in the world .
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old . My father taught me at first , and then I had one of the best teachers in the country .
I was a great player ; I won several tournaments and had a lot of fans .
My game was based on resistance ; I could play for hours . I had just one thing in my head : pass the ball no matter what .
My height was an important advantage , too ; I could reach every ball from one corner to the other .
When I talk with kids who want to start playing tennis , I always tell them that tennis is about consistency . It 's not easy ; you ca n't watch a game on TV and expect to play like them after just a couple of days — it does n't work that way .
You must train at least two hours a day , eat the right foods , avoid alcohol , and get enough sleep .
If you can do that , you are a future tennis champion .
Good luck .
Throughout my entire life , technological breakthroughs dazzled me .
At school , I was passionately engaged in my studies , trying to understand how electrical gadgets work .
On roads , I observed cars and wondered how they moved .
I enjoyed using technical devices and electrical gadgets even in bed .
However , when I was a teenager , my mother had to undergo surgery to have part of her liver removed .
This type of surgery has a low mortality risk due to the low likelihood of human error .
The operation was successful , and my mother was healthy again .
The doctor had to remove her ovaries during surgery after he accidentally caused a hemorrhage in them .
He made a human mistake , and my mother barely survived her liver operation , during which her ovaries wereHe made a human mistake , and my mother barely survived her liver operation , during which her ovaries were removed without her knowledge .
The overwhelming panic I felt during her operation and the pain we went through as a family after her surgery have changed the shape of my life forever .
Because of human error , neither my life nor my mother 's was ever the same again .
Ever since that day , I have wanted to become an engineer and design a robotic system that can perform surgeries with high accuracy , thereby eliminating the margin for human error .
I studied mechatronics engineering in the hope that , with enough knowledge and willpower , I would one day be able to work in and contribute to the field of engineering .
I am both hardworking and resilient .
Living in Aleppo , Syria , during the war has broadened my vision and expanded my horizons .
I want to contribute to improving my country and fixing what the war has broken by providing inexpensive prostheses for injured war victims .
Therefore , master 's studies would enable me to put a smile on the face of a child who may have lost their legs , but this does not necessarily mean they have lost the right to play and enjoy their childhood .
I believe in lifelong learning and am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general and German in particular .
After finishing my master 's program , I will prepare for my PhD . Besides studying in academic settings , I will continue improving my German and , in my free time , travel around Germany to learn about its rich and fascinating culture .
I believe that we , as humans , are all equal and have the same dreams and hopes .
Thus , I want to do my best to help every living being on planet Earth lead a healthy and happy life .
Not just the present generation , but also the entire human race is affected .
I think that after acquiring sufficient technical knowledge , I will be able to extend human life expectancy with robots and systems that can work together to ensure human safety .
Whether by designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic or by developing robots that can conduct surgeries with lower risk , we can improve people 's lives .
Finally , I must say that I feel the urge to help every human being I come across , regardless of race , gender , or ethnicity . I do think that we all have the power within us to achieve our dreams ; we just need strong motivation and sufficient dedication .
The sky is the limit .
The computer has been a major technological invention of great importance .
With these masterpieces , we are able to perform tasks such as writing letters with the push of a button , using programs , and even playing games .
A person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure , and , in general , a computer is a major asset in our ever-expanding , business-oriented world .
According to health experts , however , our marvellous machine causes health problems that must not be ignored .
Apart from being a necessity for some , it makes people lazy to a certain extent and thus leads us to use our brains less and less .
It is true to say that a computer can perform many hundreds of useful tasks that our brains are completely incapable of performing .
But we ought to ask ourselves , " What happens when the computer-oriented world collapses ? "
" We would then have to use our brains . "
It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine that runs on electricity .
The brain must be exercised to prepare for this possible danger in case we are disconnected from our precious computers .
We must educate ourselves more , and especially our children , who are at the forefront of tomorrow 's technology .
Hello , Jo .
In my opinion , my country , Spain , is the best place to travel .
Here you can find many wonderful cities and places to visit .
I would like to recommend two cities for you to visit .
Firstly , you must visit Sevilla .
Sevilla is in the south of Spain .
It is a large city .
It has a hot climate .
People there are very happy , and they celebrate their parties in the streets .
It is very important to stay there in spring .
Secondly , Toledo .
Toledo is in the centre of Spain .
It is a historical city .
Toledo was built on a mountain surrounded by a river .
Toledo was a place where three cultures lived .
It has an important historical centre with many museums and places to visit .
Here in Spain , it is very easy to work if you want .
Although many people are unemployed , it is known that there are many temporary jobs available .
In summer , bars and restaurants need many waiters and cooks .
These employees are temporary ; you can get some money for your trip .
Warm regards .
Rafa .
Dear Prime Editor , recently a significant number of local residents have been arguing about building the recycling plant .
Like many others , I strongly believe it will have several positive aspects for everyone .
In fact , almost all the residents in our local area believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide the jobs we need .
Our neighbourhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there has been an unbearably large increase in the amount of garbage that we want to get rid of .
Another reason is that protecting the environment has been very difficult , but by building the recycling plant it will be much easier to keep our environment healthy .
Recycling not only saves the environment but also saves you money , since buying recycled items is much cheaper .
The government has a massive responsibility to encourage people to recycle .
Finally , in my opinion , building the recycling plant is a great idea .
In fact , it is beneficial to both humans and the environment . Yours faithfully , Banhi Mohamed
Dear Tom ,
I am writing to apply for this summer camp job . I usually work with children of these ages because I am a teacher , and after school I usually prepare meals every day for many children at the same school .
In my free time , I like preparing activities for children that are normally related to sports and evening activities .
I could be considered an energetic and cheerful person . I put all my energy into the work I do and am a hardworking person .
If I have anything to do with it , I always win .
I 'm interested in this job because I enjoy learning and want to improve my work experience and my resume .
I believe I would be a suitable candidate for the job because I have everything you 're looking for .
Thanks for your consideration .
Bye .
If ever there was a false statement , it is : " There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient . "
Travelling by car , with its carbon monoxide emissions , poisons the atmosphere and contributes to global climate change .
It is killing the planet .
Our love of convenience will lead to the end of our beautiful planet and , of course , ourselves .
In most large cities around the world , cars are now inconvenient , and most people rely on public transport to get around .
The Paris Metro , New York Subway , and London Underground are all integral parts of these teeming cities .
In many cities , not only are there massive traffic jams , but there is nowhere to park your car once you get to your destination .
If there is to be a public , they will need to use and enjoy public transportation .
The model does need some work , however , such as smaller and more frequent buses during most of the day , with the big buses only coming out during rush hours .
The future is all about public transport , with the private , gas-driven car a thing of the past .
If we make it past this disaster , we will be saying , " What were we thinking ? "
Television has become an important part of our daily lives and has both advantages and disadvantages .
Nowadays , television is not only a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid ; its educational importance should not be underestimated .
It is becoming popular in schools , and its audiovisual quality makes educational programmes more effective and interesting .
Hence , schools are making use of its potential to improve education .
Most schools in the United States have television sets , and classroom lessons are often so boring that they do not appeal to most students , who therefore do not attend them .
To create interest in lessons , television is a good source .
In subjects such as science and geography , many things can be shown on television .
Hi , Nazanin !
Thank you for the postcard .
It was very nice of you .
How were your Easter holidays ?
My holidays were rather interesting , even extraordinary .
As you know , this year I celebrated Easter in Germany because the Easter holidays were very short .
So , I tried to celebrate Easter according to my Ukrainian folk traditions .
Traditionally , in the morning we have Easter Mass in the church and then an Easter breakfast .
Before the Mass , you must prepare a basket containing traditional Easter food and have it blessed at the Easter Mass .
It was not so easy to find all the food .
But at least Easter came .
The weather was amazing : it was warm and sunny , despite the fact that the day before it had been cold , windy , and hailing .
My two friends and I went to the railway station because the mess took place in Erfurt .
It was funny carrying the basket through the town because it was windy , and I had to be very careful not to let the napkin blow away .
The mess was supposed to start at 3 , but it did n't start until almost 4 .
The mess lasted approximately two and a half hours , and we expected to get home quickly because we were rather hungry .
But it had a little surprise waiting for us .
We had only taken a few steps when it suddenly started to hail .
In a few minutes , it looked like it was winter outdoors .
It was not so easy to get to the railway station because it rained and hailed and we did n't have an umbrella at all .
So we missed one train and had to wait nearly an hour for another .
We did n't get home until around 8 ; we were very hungry , but at least we had our Easter supper .
We had a great time together .
The next day , my friends came to visit me .
So it was really cool .
I hope my story was not too long .
Have you already planned anything for next weekend ?
We could go anywhere together .
I 'm waiting for your answer .
From : Mercè
To : Marta
Subject : Your family
Hi Marta ,
I 'm writing to invite you and your family to Menorca this summer .
I think you can come in the first week of July .
You can stay at my home in the countryside .
When you come , we can go to the beach in the morning and take a walk in Ciutadella in the evening . Do n't worry if you do n't want to spend a lot of money ; we can have lunch and dinner at home .
I 'm speaking with my daughter .
She is very happy because she wants to play tennis with your son .
Hope to hear from you soon !
Mercè
We are suffering a great economic crisis in Spain .
There is high inflation and a large underground economy ; as a result , our country 's education system ranks among the poorest in Europe , together with the United States and the UK .
The economic crisis is principally affecting education .
Politics is cutting back on study aids .
More and more students are unable to study because they receive little financial support .
One solution to this problem is to cut the salaries of footballers , politicians , and commentators on trashy TV shows like Sálvame .
Society is sure that if it does this , we , the students , will have enough money to study .
The authorities have been working really hard to find a way to take care of the community 's environment .
In that program , the first rule is that one day per month all neighbors go out to clean every street .
People have to separate the garbage into organic and inorganic .
They have kept garbage at their house , yet they follow the rules .
People aboard the garbage truck do n't receive the garbage .
This line graph shows the number of visitors to a selection of different museums and galleries in Sharjah . Overall , the greatest number of visitors was at the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilisation and the fewest was at the Maraya Art Centre .
The most noticeable aspect of the data for the Sharjah Art Museum is that it started in 1991 and increased slightly until 2001 , then rose sharply to reach a peak of approximately 3.2 million in 2006 ; secondly , if we look at the Sharjah Calligraphy Museum and the Sharjah Archaeology Museum , we can see that both lines started in 1991 : the Archaeology Museum began at 0.3 million , remained steady until 2001 , then increased sharply , while the Calligraphy Museum began with 1 million visitors , decreased slightly to 0.9 million by 1996 , remained stable until 2006 , and then dropped to 0.5 million .
Nowadays , public transport seems to be one of the most suitable options for travel .
This may be regarded as quite a difficult problem to solve .
More and more families are now getting used to buying their own cars rather than using public transport .
On the one hand , buying a car is worthwhile for our daily lives .
We can use it for a wide range of activities such as taking our children to school , going to our workplace , doing the shopping , and , of course , going on family vacations .
Prices may seem high at first , but cars often become very affordable later on .
But climate change is upon us , so we must ensure that every person contributes to making our environment a better place for future generations .
For instance , many examples show that public transport is improving our environment .
London 's subway , for example , carries more than one thousand people each day .
People barely use their cars in crowded cities , which is why public transport still plays a unique role in our daily lives .
Furthermore , public transport is developing new environmentally friendly engines that may provide better conditions and cleaner air for our people .
Investing in this type of transport has become a common practice among those with sufficient income who care about society .
To sum up , people will still use public transport in the future , although new changes must be made to ensure its survival .
First of all , try to organize your time for sports and music , and do your best to do both .
If you 're convinced you can not do both , think about two things : first , which activity will give you a better future , and second , which of these activities you like the most . In my opinion .
I think sports will give you many more benefits than music , because you do what you like and , at the same time , exercise .
I really hope this helps you .
Sincerely , Hector .
Many people believe that being famous is fantastic . Everyone on the street wants to get a picture with you , and you have many fans .
Being popular is cool because everyone knows you .
Another good thing about it is that you 're easily distinguishable .
On the other hand , you 're observed all the time by cameras , paparazzi , and fans , even when you 're at home or on holiday with your family .
You ca n't even go shopping without being noticed .
I 'm sure that the next day your photo will be on the front page of the daily news .
What 's more , journalists are just waiting for your mistake , an inaccurate statement , or compromising behaviour .
Moreover , politicians in particular are exposed to attacks by brazen journalists who hunt for them .
In my opinion , famous people deserve to have private lives without journalists following them .
Nowadays everyone wants to know what an idol 's private life looks like , so I think it 's very hard for famous people to preserve their privacy .
Nowadays , many aspects of the world are highly developed , such as education , transportation , and people 's lives .
I 'm sure that these will develop more in the future .
In the future , education will change a lot ; I think it will alter how we teach and what we learn .
Scientists will create a pen that can write in space ; with this pen , teachers wo n't need to go to a classroom with a board and can write wherever they want . A device that helps students who ca n't attend school will provide lessons and allow them to discuss with their friends comfortably .
Regarding transportation in the next 50 years , cars powered by solar energy will become popular , and car-related environmental pollution will disappear .
The number of people who walk to school or to the place where they work will increase .
This is a good change .
People 's lives will change , too . At that time , maybe each family will have a robot that does housework .
People do n't want to spend a lot of time on housework ; instead , they can relax after work or do other activities .
People 's lifestyles will be more comfortable .
I think there will be many changes in the future .
All About Me
Hello , I 'm Ailsa Dael Lam and I 'm thirteen years old .
I was born in the Netherlands in a town called Utrecht .
It is a nice town in the center of the Netherlands .
Some people think I was born in Holland , but that is not right .
I was born in the Netherlands .
Holland is a region in the west of the Netherlands .
Amsterdam , the capital of the country , is there too .
About two years before I was born , my sister Jette was born .
She is now fifteen years old .
I also have a father named Geurt , a Dutch name that is hard for Swedish people to pronounce , and a mother named Willemien .
We always had animals in our family .
Fred was the first cat I ever had .
He was always in my bed when I was a baby .
He had a special voice .
It was loud , and everyone knew who he was because of it .
But now he is dead .
He died when he was eighteen years old .
Today we have a dog , Silas , and two other cats called Selma and Romeo .
When Selma was one year old , she got five kittens .
One of them was Romeo .
They are not as nice to each other today as they were when they were smaller .
I moved to Sweden ten years ago .
We moved because of nature and because we wanted adventure .
There is n't much nature in the Netherlands .
When we moved to Sweden , I could feel how much cleaner the air was .
We rented a house near the water .
After a few years , we moved to the house at Edsviksvägen 118 in Danderyd , where we still live today .
We did n't move very far ; we moved to a bigger , much nicer house .
Every Wednesday , before I go to my dance class , I go to the Dutch school .
There I learn about Dutch grammar so that I 'm on the same level as Dutch children my age .
If I want to , I can study in the Netherlands because of this .
I like to dance and to play field hockey .
I play field hockey on Sundays and I dance on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
Most Swedes do n't know what field hockey is , but it is a sport much like bandy ; the main difference is the type of stick used .
I feel happy and free when I play hockey and dance .
I like sports , but I definitely like animals too .
Last summer I was in Spain with my cousins . It was the best holiday ever .
We lived at a campsite near the sea .
I made my first scuba dive there .
It was so funny .
When I slowly sank into the water , I heard the sound of the bubbles .
I saw three red sea stars and many fish .
I would really like to go diving in Australia someday .
I also swam a lot with my cousins .
One of my favorite memories is when Selma got five kittens .
It was so nice to play with them , and they were so cute .
She got them one night in May . I heard the sound of a cat and woke up .
When I looked to my left , I saw Selma in a basket , but she was n't alone .
There were a few other kittens in the basket !
I called them Romeo , Rebecka , Suchi , Ronja , and Viggo .
All of them were white with black spots except one , Ronja , who was black with a white stomach .
My favorite restaurant is Bonbon in Stockholm .
There , they have small dishes of fish , meat , or vegetables .
When you want one of the small dishes , they put a small ball in a glass .
When you have to pay , they look at how many balls are in the glass and then count how many you have to pay for .
It 's very nice there , and you do n't have to choose just one dish ; you can eat several smaller dishes .
I also like Italian food at restaurants like Ciao Ciao Duo in Stockholm .
When I grow up , I want to be a veterinarian .
That 's because I love animals and I want to help them when they are sick .
I think many veterinarians charge too much for something you can also do at home .
I do n't want to be like that , and I want to start my own animal hospital .
My favorite color is blue .
It 's not just one sort of blue , but all sorts of blue .
I also like pink .
I have many more favorite books than colors .
I really like The Hunger Games , but I also like books by John Boyne , such as The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas .
I also like I Am Malala and The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini .
I like to read books about war and the Taliban because I think they are interesting and exciting .
These stories are often very sad , and I like to read that sort of story .
That was a little about me .
Thank you for listening .

The recent developments in the field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century , starting with the discovery of DNA and the mapping and understanding of its structure .
The manipulation of genes is an incredibly important and dangerously powerful ability that can not be left simply to scientists to look after .
We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering , whether for medical or commercial reasons .
Tomatoes are designed and engineered to last longer ; apples , to grow bigger ; crops , to ripen later to allow time for transport ; and pigs are used to produce insulin for human use .
The list is enormous .
Along with the many advantages , there are dangers .
New biological weapons are being developed all over the world ; for example , the ability to transfer genes that cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold could , without much doubt , wipe out a significant percentage of the human race .
There need not be a war for something this disastrous to occur ; these genetically engineered microbes could be released accidentally while they are being investigated in an unsealed laboratory .
If we are going to accept the advantages that come with genetic engineering , we must also take responsibility for the disadvantages ; the stakes are too high to leave this to the scientists , and they can not be expected to take moral responsibility for people who misuse those discoveries or inventions and thereby cause disaster .
Governments should ensure that money is invested not only in genetic engineering research , but also in safeguarding the results of that research .
I recommend visiting the Guido Mine .
It 's an old mine that was converted into a cultural zone in our city .
Of course , it 's still a mine , so you can see all the mining equipment used ; Zabrze is located in Silesia , a coal-mining area .
It was established in 1855 by Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck , so the mine was named after him .
It has such a rich history that I ca n't just tell you everything in one email .
I can only say that the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 320 .
The first one , level 170 , presents mining methods , the work of miners in the late 19th century , and the history of that industry in Silesia .
This level is an interactive form of sightseeing supported by lights and sounds .
The main purpose is to shock the visitor and make him feel something , and in my opinion it surely does .
The visitors may be surprised by the crackling of the ceiling or the squealing of rats .
There are also many exhibitions organised throughout the year .
A highly qualified guide is waiting for every group of visitors , and he 's ready for even the most serious avalanche of questions .
Along the sightseeing route , you can also find a chapel , a place that is very important to the locals and where important celebrations are held .
At level 320 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a longwall coal-cutting machine in operation .
You can also touch real coal with your hands .
Many concerts , exhibitions , and theatre plays are also organised .
And if you get hungry , you can try something regional—you can be sure the cooks wo n't let you starve .
I think the Guido Mine is well worth visiting .
Love ,

Nowadays , the aeroplane is considered an ordinary part of our lives .
Its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another .
However , a few decades ago , we had a very limited notion of such technology .
Yet at present it is so ubiquitous that we seem not to take notice of the air .
If one were to delve into the most important inventions of the last century , one would probably cite modern conveniences , namely the television and the computer .
We tend to underrate the importance of the aeroplane .
It is obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conceive of the world .
Firstly , as a result of its development , we can experience a noticeable surge in mass tourism .
People have ample opportunities to set off on riveting journeys to places they previously imagined while reading an adventure book .
Besides , the great influence of the aeroplane can be seen in mass emigration .
Had it not been for the Wright brothers , emigrants and casualties would not have been able to settle in remote lands ; hence the world would teeter financially .
As far as the vast changes the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society 's attitude has also improved .
In the first place , for decades we had a distant relationship with such an initially fallible workhorse .
A classic illustration of this could be the use of aircraft solely for military purposes .
Because the 20th century was dominated by wars , people only killed and exterminated one another .
Additionally , creating such a vehicle has been our morbid fascination since time immemorial .
Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalised .
Air travel has transformed from a luxury available only to the rich into something accessible to almost everyone .
I personally believe that the influence the aeroplane has had on our lives is significant , yet we must bear in mind the dangers connected with it .
For instance , at the beginning of the 21st century , tourists were under the constant threat of terrorists .
Moreover , the opportunities provided by air technology may readily contribute to further development .
Perhaps it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London could be done in the twinkling of an eye .
To sum up , the aviation industry and its changes have been important to the world .
Apart from a few minor drawbacks , we can only laud its benefits .
It has certainly had an edifying effect on our thinking about travelling .
Many years ago , people lived without many of the things we have nowadays , such as mobile phones , LED TVs , and computers .
This means that we have experienced an important change over time , which is due to the rise of technology and entails that people 's lives have changed .
Now , will we continue to develop our technology and our lives ?
From my point of view , technology will continue to change our lives in terms of routine and free time to the point that we will not be able to live without it .
This is a problem ; we must not depend on items like phones , TVs , and other devices created by technology .
If we had to live in the past , given our dependence on technology , we would not be able to live in this way ; I am sure of it .
Nonetheless , I think people 's lives will improve thanks to technology : it is not only associated with negative effects such as dependence , but also offers innovations like new technologies and information systems that can improve the job market and a wide range of sectors , such as agriculture and healthcare .
Finally , to sum up , I think that people 's lives will change , but not dramatically ; it depends on each person and the way in which they focus their lives .
Unfortunately , I have n't seen any thrillers for ages .
I prefer other genres .
I saw a really great comedy by Wes Anderson last month .
Its title is The Hotel Grand Budapest .
The story took place in Eastern Europe between the two World Wars .
The hotel manager used to take care of his regular clients , especially elderly women .
The hotel flourished , and the manager felt like a god and behaved like one in his small universe .
He hired the teenage Indian refugee as a bellboy and taught him all of his skills .
He taught the boy many lessons about hospitality , friendship , courage , and humanity .
An old man returned to the place of his youth and told the story of his friend and master .
Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there are other solutions , such as online platforms that facilitate car-sharing at a relatively low price with people who are travelling to the same destination .
Sharing a car could be an alternative way to save money , and it 's also more comfortable than traveling with many people .
First of all , public transport has fewer options ; for example , it is very difficult to travel if you have to work night shifts , and on certain days it is impossible to get a seat .
On the other hand , if you miss the bus , train , or any other form of public transportation , you may have to wait a long time for the next one , which is maddening .
In conclusion , people prefer travelling by car because it is more comfortable : they can go wherever they want at the time they consider best and choose whether to share the space with others .
Nowadays , people spend a lot of money to go to English-speaking countries to improve their language skills .
But is it really the most effective way to learn a language ?
From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks .
Firstly , this option is very expensive , as tuition fees for overseas students are rather high .
Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .
What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian , so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanations .
It is often assumed that studying a language abroad is better because you can always use it by speaking with native speakers .
However , I doubt that we will have many opportunities to speak while we are abroad , as we do not know many people there .
It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England .
I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can better compare the two languages and explain grammar rules more effectively .
To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country , because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
Moreover , today we have many opportunities to improve our skills , such as communicating with English-speaking pen pals over the Internet .
I think we should travel abroad to practise a language , not to study it .
