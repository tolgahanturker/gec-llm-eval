Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to your likelihood of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People develop certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chances of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have genetic changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , this does not mean you will definitely develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you will develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain genetic changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
If we are diagnosed with a genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger to have frightening effects on our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes will easily change , either by caring for us too much or by keeping away from us .
Neither is what we want , since most of us just want to live normal lives .
Surrounded by such concerns , we are very likely to be distracted and to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us throughout our whole lives , because we will never know when the 'potential bomb ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us control or cure the disease , we can go through this process as a whole family .
For example , if exercise helps reduce a family 's risk of disease , we can always look for more opportunities for the family to exercise .
We keep track of all family members ' health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when other members get this disease .
Here , I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual found to carry the dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to their siblings , there is currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , many consider it ethically dubious to require someone to inform family members who are therefore also at risk about his or her genetic risk .
"
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a genetic test for a certain disease is very accurate , and disclosure is unavoidable and necessary to obtain treatment or to inform others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than secrecy .
Genetic risk carries consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another , even though the families have a common genetic makeup shared by either parent .
In cases where an individual has become aware of a genetic disorder , whether to disclose it to their relatives is solely a matter of preference within that individual 's moral system .
The issue of the right to know or not to know is highly debatable ; even if it is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could come from either parent 's side of the family—maternal or paternal uncles , aunts , or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of their genetic profile , they concurrently gain knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Does someone who has suffered from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that one undergoes periodic health checks on one 's own .
Sometimes family structure and cultural beliefs can influence patterns of communication .
Depending on whether the genetic risk was discovered in the son or the daughter , the parents who know about it would decide who gets told and who has precedence in being allowed to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , including adult offspring at risk .
In addition , a woman who tests positive for a BRCA1 mutation may be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose this information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated if relatives do not want to know about the risk .
Hence , there were also tensions when participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended vertically .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when the grandmother herself is not at genetic risk but the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because , if lay constructs of family and kinship are social constructs , they may not align with geneticists ' views of family relationships or with views about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom . This is also likely to depend on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must draw attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk in making considered decisions about disclosure .
Whether it is someone 's duty to inform at-risk relatives depends greatly on personal morality and on how directly the risk affects them .
People who are closely related by blood generally share some genes .
In this case , if a family member or close relative is found to carry a genetic risk , the patient should tell their close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that their family members can adopt daily exercises to help prevent the potential disease or visit a hospital for appropriate tests .
In my opinion , although carrying a genetic risk raises issues of personal privacy , carriers should be required to inform their relatives so they can take steps to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first .
Many patients with a genetic risk would want to keep it secret , as the risk may indicate they have a high chance of carrying a certain disease .
Especially for young unmarried people , if they are known to have a genetic risk , there is a chance that their child could inherit the same disease , but this is not certain .
Therefore , keeping the information secret from their future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause family members to be scared of the issue ; even if the risk is not serious , people may still fear they could develop a disease in the future and therefore go to the hospital for additional tests or take more medicine to prevent it , creating unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect relationships with relatives , as some may choose to avoid close contact with the carrier to reduce their risk of developing the disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept secret , it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help protect their privacy , but it can have much larger negative impacts on family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest with their spouse and tell them they may carry certain genetic risks that could affect their offspring .
It is better to inform the other party of the fact before the baby is born , rather than after a certain type of genetic disease is discovered .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic diseases are closely related to inherited genes as well as to daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he or she is at risk of developing diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat fewer candies and chocolates to avoid consuming too much sugar , and if the carrier tells relatives , it will help them know that they may develop diabetes in the future because of related genes and that they can take similar measures to reduce their sugar intake and help prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties do not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without taking any preventive measures .
In conclusion , the benefits of informing carriers ' relatives about genetic risk outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better to require the carrier to inform their relatives so they can take steps to prevent potential illness through regular exercise .
Among various diseases , many are caused by genetic factors .
Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary , and it is sometimes hard to find out that one has them .
There has long been a debate about whether carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives that their disease is genetic .
From a legal standpoint , the answer is no , but from an ethical standpoint , it should be yes .
We ca n't make a law that forces a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about it .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , what kind of disease someone has is their private matter .
Protection of privacy is a human right .
If a law requires someone to disclose another person 's private information , especially when that person is unwilling to do so .
It is against his or her human rights and against the spirit of the law .
The spirit of the law also includes fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to pass a law that singles out genetic disorders .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to enforce .
However , there are many problems with asking a carrier to tell their relatives the cause of their disease .
First , what is the range of the relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell their direct relatives , like parents and siblings , or do they also need to tell relatives such as their grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you say you only need to tell direct relatives , it would be unfair under the law .
Other relatives may also have the same risk of developing such a disease .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face a potential disease ?
However , from an ethical point of view , this is problematic .
The carrier himself or herself should feel a responsibility to inform his or her relatives of their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save the lives of some of their relatives .
This is because a carrier of a deleterious gene may not necessarily develop the associated genetic disease if they maintain a healthy lifestyle before the gene 's effects strengthen with age .
A typical example is genetically caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems that make it harder for the body to metabolize fats and sodium in the blood .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may increase their risk of developing hypertension , they should take preventive measures .
They can develop a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society can not force a carrier of a genetic condition to tell their relatives about it , but the carrier should be willing to inform them .
By doing so , fewer of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , many medical breakthroughs have become possible .
Genetic testing is available for individuals to decide whether to undergo it .
It can detect diseases and even determine a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue when a carrier of a known genetic risk faces the dilemma of whether to inform their relatives .
If knowledge of the genetic risk were shared with family members or relatives , they might discover they carry it in their blood and could take necessary precautions to prevent it .
But if it is a terminal genetic disease , most relatives will be disheartened to learn about it .
Therefore , some carriers may prefer to keep it secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should inform their relatives .
Some people say that a person 's genetic risk should be kept confidential because it is personal information .
Most patients will be depressed after realizing their condition .
If a person learns from a test that they have a genetic disease , they might not wish to inform their relatives , as doing so might dishearten their extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves , hoping to avoid bringing any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some people will not want to become a burden on anyone because seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some saw it as considerate to keep the genetic risk of contracting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it would be considerate to inform the relatives because they are more likely to have the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or take measures to reduce their risk of contracting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic disease is involved , given the current state of medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease , and it can be cured if it is detected at an early stage .
Hence , knowing their genetic risk , relatives of affected individuals may undergo medical checkups , which might enable earlier detection .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform relatives of their risk of developing the same genetic disease .
Although there may be many challenges when seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know about their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant of it and will continue to lead happy lives .
In addition , some may think that even knowing they have a genetic risk for the disease will just add to their misery because there is nothing they can do about it .
All in all , it depends on the individual and the nature of the disease , but they should be obliged to inform their relatives if it can be cured or prevented .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , made with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier .
Those born into families with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing even if there is no risk at all .
Early screening is beneficial , as it dispels unwanted doubts and improves the psychological well-being of those affected .
A person who carries a genetic risk should be given the choice of whether to inform their relatives .
A genetic risk carrier should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may drastically and negatively affect their emotions .
Regarding this choice , there must be rules governing the exercise of personal freedom in decision-making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor , the decision to inform the relative should most likely be made in consultation with the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients may still be emotionally volatile or unaware of the consequences of the genetic disorder because of their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological well-being of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be given to the immediate family , as this could lead to a series of unwanted events involving the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt , with regard to their pride or reputation , upon learning that such a genetic disorder runs in their family .
However , they have a duty to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
The genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and other members of the same family tree .
Informing relatives about such a genetic disease is vital , as it may help raise awareness and promote prevention of the disorder .
Also , this information will help their relatives make informed decisions and undergo genetic testing themselves to find out the outcome .
Knowing that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial to their emotional well-being .
If the results turn out otherwise , the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the outcome and aided in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it were made known to them .
Support from relatives is vital , as it reassures the person at genetic risk that he or she is not alone in facing the illness and provides a morale boost , since the whole family shares a common concern about the disorder 's future implications , which could affect anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives about such a genetic disorder will depend on the situation and the background of the affected family , with the family given the freedom to decide whether to inform others .
A person with a disorder , whether mental or physical , is always easily noticed by his or her family .
When it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorders are inherited from generation to generation , but not all offspring show the associated symptoms .
Sometimes a family at risk for a genetic disorder may not be able to detect the potential harm in its members because none of them exhibit any observable symptoms of the disorder .
As a result , if one of the members feels unwell or abnormal , he or she should be aware of whether the disorder affecting his or her body is genetic .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue : whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives .
If the symptoms of the disorder appear in a child , the medical staff will inform the parents , and the whole family will remain vigilant about their health .
Conversely , if the carrier is an adult who can decide whether to inform their relatives about the risk , the situation is more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves their family more than they love themselves , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true , and of course it is a family member 's obligation to protect and care for the family .
Think of it another way : if a child in the family knows he is at risk of being a genetic carrier , and that risk could be passed on to his child in the future , he will face a lifelong dilemma .
Of course , he or she will consider not having any children after getting married , and the same applies to the cousins .
As a result , the family generation stops at the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think that having more children and grandchildren will make the family livelier and stronger .
The reason for this is that after WWII China 's population decreased dramatically , so the government encouraged people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members exhibits symptoms of a genetic disorder , he will face an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical technology at that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or to make his family more prosperous despite a potential risk .
So he would have chosen not to undergo testing for genetic disorders and to let the truth remain hidden forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duties of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should carefully consider the consequences of telling their relatives about a genetic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform their relatives , and family members also have an obligation to enliven the family .
Regardless of whether the disorder is rarely fatal or causes no inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell their relatives about it .
One of the reasons is that , as a carrier , they need mental support to get through this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
If she tells her family , they could possibly help her find alternative solutions to the problem she is currently facing .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support for our careers .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it would be better for the carrier to inform his or her family , as other family members might experience the same thing .
If they are made aware of this genetic problem , they can have a full check-up and may even be able to prevent it .
I find it important to inform others , especially if the disease is contagious , because the carrier could help prevent it from spreading through society .
For every action , there are pros and cons .
I believe some carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to family members because they do not want to make them worry or feel uncomfortable , and they fear being ostracized by them .
Furthermore , since it could require spending a lot of money on treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden on her family .
I could understand how the carrier felt .
He or she does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will occur when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feelings , and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in his or her life .
If something happens to the carrier and her family is not informed , they would deeply regret it if she were to die without their knowledge .
On top of that , it is better to discuss her problem with family members , since more people can help think of solutions than she can on her own .
In the end , I believe that emotional and even financial support from your family could help the carrier fight the genetic disease .
It 's true that many cancer patients have been given a second chance to live a normal life because they have strong emotional support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease when it comes to us , even if we are fragile and weak .
As technology has advanced , it has reached a stage where its development raises ethical dilemmas regarding its actual use .
Genetic testing has made it possible to determine whether a person is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness ; however , it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is in the family .
The question posed is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has the right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier . However , the carrier can choose not to be tested and simply live with uncertainty and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live with the uncertainty the gene entails and is willing to accept it , he can do so ; after all , it was normal for everyone in the past , since genetic testing was not possible .
It might be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a way to prevent the birth of children with disabilities and spare them from suffering in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of undergoing genetic testing , so that a family that can not afford to have a disabled child does not have to give birth to one and cause the entire family to suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to be obligated to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemmas .
If the result turned out to be something the carrier could not accept , it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the truth .
After realizing that he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family and create more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier whether to share the hard facts with relatives , but he still has no obligation to do so .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of undergoing genetic testing and take appropriate action based on the results .
The depression a carrier may experience and the feelings of guilt may be greater than expected and could remain a burden on their mind for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , if the family does not know of any genetic disorder and accepts the situation , they will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will remain mentally healthy as it is , without experiencing emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be shared with others , especially close family members , is a topic worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as a family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , a few arguments will be presented in support of the view that any carrier of a known genetic risk should inform his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family , who welcomed us into this new world .
We were crying hard , but we were not alone ; it was our family and relatives who raised us .
Hence , they should be the people we are grateful to and the people with whom we would like to share our joy .
However , in cases involving any health issue or a serious disorder , there may seem to be no point in sharing , but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
People have the right to disclose their health issues to anyone , but they also have a responsibility to inform family and close relatives .
Because this health issue is related to genetic risk , the keyword " genetic " highlights the possibility of passing the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to inform their relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future .
Although one may argue that disclosing such a health issue or bearing it is up to the individual , it 's certainly helpful to share it with close relatives to have a proper discussion about possible solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed when facing such a risk of disorder .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care toward the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting against the risk of such disorders .
On top of that , because the genetic risk may be passed down to the next generation , it will involve more than one family .
Therefore , I would agree that there is an obligation to inform the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and plans to have a child .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are additional intangible advantages that could support informing the relatives once the test results are known .
In conclusion , to avoid family-related ethical dilemmas , anyone who is a carrier of a known genetic risk should inform their relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh the disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better guidance when someone is at such a junction about whether they should inform their relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law of the society .
However , it raises a new problem : Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" This issue has been discussed for a long time . "
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among the people .
Thus , we will identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue " should or should not . "
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence below : " I will be anxious about my family when they tell me that they are a carrier of a known genetic risk . "
Frequently , carriers do not want to tell their families because they intend to continue their lives without causing their families anxiety .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than for many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves .
With the families ' support , there will be more energy to fight the demon .
A demon is not easily defeated , and defeating it requires a great deal of energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support that you can not get on your own .
Those are the most essential elements for overcoming the challenges .
Besides that , the risk associated with the known genetic condition is so serious that it can not be described .
The seriousness may be greater than we can imagine .
Lying in bed for the rest of one 's life , or even dying immediately , are consequences we can not imagine .
Family is the dearest thing in our lives .
We would n't have been able to stay until now without their concern and support .
They play an important role in our lives that can not be replaced .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to inform the relatives in order to prevent undesirable consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not notify the carrier 's family without the carrier 's consent .
It is the duty of hospital staff to keep patients ' information confidential .
We can not blame them for being subject to the undesirable consequences .
However , the hospital can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about actions that can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of circumstance will not happen again .
It is a method that benefits both parties , making it a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to inform their relatives about it .
However , there may be some special cases that are difficult to define .
Thus , advice from the hospital plays an important role in this .
Carriers are responsible for balancing their own interests with the benefits of their family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make , but if handled appropriately , it will create excellent circumstances for your career and family in the future .
With the risk of a genetic disorder , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
Because the results are known once the tests are done , each individual diagnosed as a carrier of a genetic risk faces an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being carriers of the same genetic condition .
They can choose to remain silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In my view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their relatives for the following reasons .
First of all , from a human-rights perspective , a person who carries a genetic risk should not be obligated to disclose it to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy for carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their lives , or they may want to keep it secret and not let others know about it .
This is reasonable , since revealing that someone is a carrier may lead others to discriminate against or pity them , which are not positive factors in their lives .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to undergo genetic testing regardless of the carrier 's diagnosis .
When people want to check whether they carry genetic risks , they can consult a doctor .
If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a problem , they may simply ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell their relatives , the relatives will be forced to learn that they have an increased chance of being carriers of a genetic risk .
This depends on their willingness , because they must accept the truth , which may make the rest of their lives miserable .
Many people may argue that making it mandatory could help more people , the relatives of carriers , save their lives by enabling early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological and social influences , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may become scared about an uncertain future ; partners , spouses , and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may occur that could ruin the relative 's life .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants confirmation and is prepared to face the result can choose to undergo genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives .
This should be accepted on the grounds of human rights , the freedom of relatives to accept it , and many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For carriers of a genetic disorder , knowing that they are carriers causes more dilemmas than actually having the disorder .
I agree that someone who carries a known genetic risk is obligated to inform their relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy about sharing their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and their family can take precautions , physically by taking steps to reduce the chance of the condition being passed on to offspring , and mentally to cope if those steps fail .
Many syndromes , such as Down syndrome and Taylor syndrome , can be prevented from occurring if the mother receives proper medication and does not consume harmful substances during pregnancy .
This information may not be known to her relatives if she does n't tell them about her condition .
The more people ( relatives ) who know about her problem , the more channels of information are available .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to provide a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parents ' fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So they also have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases incur high costs for treatment and medication .
Albinism is one example .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and need regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are more prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their bodies well , such as by wearing sunglasses or applying sunscreen when outdoors , they are likely to develop skin problems that may lead to cancer .
Once you are diagnosed with cancer , the cost of medication is very high .
To prevent the bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does n't tell their relatives , it may be too late to get their support and to prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the conditions is sickle cell trait .
Usually , people are not aware that they carry the sickle cell gene , and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood blockage .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose this to their relatives , they can bring their children for genetic testing and need not be shy about it , because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for parents to give a mental boost to their children with genetic disorders .
When their children become teenagers , many social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock your conditions .
A strong mental state and conviction must be built from within and from those closest to you .
If it 's not their family , then who else would be willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy burden for the family if they first prepare themselves mentally by being informed about the likelihood that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In the modern world , technology has improved a lot compared with the last century .
Particularly in the medical field , there have been great improvements in treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell their relatives about it .
This is because their relatives have the right to know .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can affect the carrier 's relatives ; if one family member is at risk , other relatives are likely to have a similar risk , so the family should treat this problem seriously .
Every family member has the human right to know what is happening to them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk of a genetic disorder , how can this justify their right ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder , but he does not tell his sibling James about it .
Although it 's somewhat horrible to tell James about this , he should know what 's likely to happen to him .
This might benefit his future if he is aware of the risks of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness that they may have the same genetic disorder , helping to prevent it from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but advances in medical treatment have made it possible for people to prevent them or to reduce their negative effects on themselves .
In addition , doctors often quote the saying " Prevention is better than cure , " which suggests that preventing a disorder from occurring is far more advantageous than curing it .
Awareness of a genetic disorder may help diagnose the condition in a person and therefore make its prevention possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent it from happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , including eating a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be required to inform their relatives .
They have a human right to know about this , and it may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from occurring .
With advances in technology over the past decades , medical progress has accelerated exponentially , and further improvements continue to be made . Empowered with advanced medical knowledge , doctors can diagnose conditions and order genetic testing to help patients prevent disease and take necessary steps to protect their lives . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , the question of whether to disclose the results to relatives becomes a challenging issue for both patient and doctor . I strongly support an obligation to inform patients ' relatives .
Because this is a genetic risk , the patient 's next of kin may be at higher risk , so it is important to inform relatives so that preventive measures can be taken . For example , if you are an only child and suffer from a genetic disease that could be passed to your children , informing your family members may reduce pressure on you to settle down and have children , thereby lessening family stress and suffering . However , ethical and social issues such as discrimination and privacy are major concerns and potential barriers to requiring patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives . This challenges principles of confidentiality and privacy . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient whether to inform family members . Early disclosure to family members can have positive effects for prevention . For example , Angelina Jolie chose to disclose her situation and underwent treatment that reduced her risk of breast cancer to under five percent . I recall she said she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people opposed to revealing private information . In the case of patients with Alzheimer 's disease , it is the patient 's choice whether to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to determine who , how , and to whom a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease should be disclosed to minimize potential negative impact on family members ( DementiaToday , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to patients with Alzheimer 's disease , such as the Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) . Although there are still thousands of genetic-risk diseases that may not receive help and support from everyone , receiving immediate understanding and support from family members is of utmost importance to patients during their difficult times .
In conclusion , the state should pass a law defining to what extent a doctor may disclose information about a genetic disease to relatives and in which situations disclosure should be left to the patient 's decision . In addition , the state could encourage the creation of assistance schemes to provide necessary help to needy patients and encourage them to disclose information for the benefit of themselves and their family members . Although this may face challenges from social and ethical issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and support from the government , more individuals would become more accepting and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of their loved ones .
Nowadays , research in the field of genetics has progressed rapidly due to technological advances .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , began .
By comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to become aware of their risk of a possible genetic disorder , an even more popular topic arises because the technology is already quite mature .
While most people agree that each individual has the right to decide whether to undergo genetic testing , they differ on whether sharing the results with relatives is the patient 's responsibility or a matter of personal freedom .
In my opinion , patients who are carriers of a known genetic risk should share this information with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people .
It is the duty of the whole society .
Taking H1N1 as an example , all people in Singapore , including students in schools , travelers at Changi Airport , office workers , and people on the street , are required by law to take their temperature and report their results to the relevant government authority .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put them in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without any doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to inform their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and to help preserve the family line .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death .
Family members , as one of the closest sources of comfort , are a crucial factor in helping them successfully overcome any difficulties resulting from a genetic disorder .
A 2010 study at New York University showed that patients with family members present generally recover 2–4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses .
Even for patients with terminal illnesses , survival time is 30 % longer with family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arouse unnecessary doubts and panic , which will endanger family harmony .
While every family needs to go through one troublesome situation or another , the more troubles a family experiences together , the stronger the bond between its members and the greater their trust , love , and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in and loves one another , all these troubles are merely tests to make them stronger .
As Kelly Clarkson 's lyrics say , " What does n't kill you makes you stronger . "
As someone living in an Asian society where genetic testing is uncommon , I believe it is the patient 's choice whether to tell their relatives about their disease .
The decision to undergo genetic testing and to inform one 's relatives about a possible risk may lead people to be judgmental , even though it is only a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's genes that are affected , they have the right to determine with whom they want to share the information .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell their relatives about the genetic risk , I would suggest that they at least share this information with their potential partner ( husband or wife ) , since the carrier 's genetic risk may affect any future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about genetic diseases , and are therefore likely to judge or at least treat those affected differently , since they consider them abnormal or " weird " .
This is because many people associate genetic diseases with conditions such as bubble boy disease , autism , or Down syndrome .
In such diseases , many affected people have different physical characteristics compared to people without them .
Although we know we should not discriminate against people because of their limitations , many still do so , whether they realize it or not .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives that he is at risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and equal treatment like others , and therefore for them to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case others judge them or treat them differently . Many people prefer to hear what they want to hear and therefore may ignore the word " risk " and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I feel it is up to the person whether to share the information with their family , since their family may be paranoid , judge them , and act differently .
Especially when it is only a risk , the option really belongs to him since he is not an actual sufferer .
Some people argue that it is necessary to inform family members about the risk since some of them may be affected ; while I agree this has merit , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue is also an important consideration .
Maybe we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , because genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal matter , it is up to the individual whether to tell their relatives .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least inform their future partner about the potential risk , since their genetic risk may affect any children they have later .
This information should at least be acknowledged by the other party before they decide to marry and have children .
There may be cases in which both the husband and wife are carriers , and therefore they should not have children , since their children may not survive after birth .
In a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This information plays a role in family planning ; therefore , although no one is obliged to disclose their genetic risk to anyone , they should be encouraged to inform their future partner .
In conclusion , whether the carrier wants to tell his relatives about his genetic risk is his choice , because it concerns his genetic information and he has the full right to decide .
He may have different considerations , such as fear of being judged or concern that telling his relatives would needlessly worry his family , and whatever choice he makes we must respect ; we have no right to say that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless , and we have no right to judge someone 's death .
With improvements in technology , the genetic risks to a new life can be detected .
Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma arises : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell their relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children are at genetic risk .
One of the reasons parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
A child with a genetic risk may not be able to work or contribute to the family , and is often not accepted by the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy what normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives often have to work longer than expected and tirelessly to care for their child if the child can not care for themselves .
The situation may become worse if the child has a disease such as cancer or heart disease , which means that parents face another heavy burden : medical expenses .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still too early for parents to decide whether they can foster a child who will be unable to work and may suffer pain throughout their life .
The other reason parents should know that their baby is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation 's good .
There are always newspaper reports of newborn babies being abandoned at hospitals after their parents realize the babies have diseases that require a huge amount of money to treat .
Countries like Singapore lack sufficient manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot of money to help people with disabilities , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
Without increasing the number of people with disabilities in a nation , the government can concentrate on developing other areas , such as the military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have a responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world today , many miscarriages occur in hospitals .
It is easier for people to accept morally .
Therefore , I believe parents have the right to know their child 's health status .
Many people may support the theory that everyone has the right to enjoy the world , especially religious people .
However , the problem is : will people really enjoy their lives if they have to stay in the hospital every day and endure all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , so they will make the right decision after they have been informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control over one 's information and the right to decide whether to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have a baby , they are going to run a few tests to see whether the baby could have any genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason given by those who support this view is that relatives of carriers are at high risk of being carriers of these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , informing them of the results can significantly reduce the cost of multiple testing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the risk of contracting this disease .
If a person has disease C , it might be the result of gene A .
He runs a test and knows that he has the AA gene .
This means both of his parents have the A gene and are at high risk of disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of disease C. If he runs a test , he will find that he has the Aa gene .
This means that one of his parents has gene A , and the cost of one test could be saved .
If this disease can somehow be prevented , his relatives can then take measures to stop it from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved through personal choice .
One can choose to tell one 's relatives if those relatives are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives . If there are no serious consequences to telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint to or encourage certain relatives to undergo genetic testing if those relatives are concerned about negative consequences that could arise when they disclose their genetic results .
There may be negative consequences for individuals who disclose their genetic results to a relative .
If a person is obliged to tell their relatives , they might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has the genotype Aa and the genotype aa is sufficient to cause a very serious disease .
After he takes the test and is obliged to tell his relatives , everyone will know that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples get tested and learn they are not carriers . They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who also carries this gene .
Third , it is hard to define " relatives . "
If a gene runs in the family and one family member tests positive , whom does he need to tell ?
If that is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships . If person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C learns about it and tells his wife D that he needs to get tested because his cousin has this disease .
However , wife D is not even at risk of having this disease .
Then , wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , half the town knows that Person A has a risky gene , and his family may be at genetic risk .
Then nobody wants to marry A or his relatives .
This is a potential consequence if one does not have full control over their information , especially when the party to whom they are obliged to disclose it is a potentially large group ( e.g. , relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their relatives .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
Nowadays , people not only pursue comfort in their own lives but also seek better development for future generations .
As modern technology has advanced , people can now decide to undergo genetic testing to determine whether they carry genetic risks that could affect the next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk .
In my opinion , the responsibility to inform family and relatives is obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first is the importance of being responsible for your own wellness and your relatives ' health , and the second is being responsible for future generations .
Your relatives ' awareness of your genetic risk is good for your well-being and for their health .
If you carry that genetic risk , there is a good chance your relatives , such as your parents or siblings , also carry it .
The genetic risk you carry may or may not affect your health or put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone genetic testing , then what will happen to both of you and your relatives is just a matter of chance and fate .
However , if you have been tested and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to avoid getting the disease by being alert .
As for family members who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital for regular checkups .
Therefore , it is your responsibility to tell families and relatives to prepare to fight the disease and even to prevent it .
Furthermore , you are also responsible to future generations by telling them that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , your child could also carry the same genetic risk .
As a parent , you are not responsible to your future generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on from generation to generation despite being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you give them the chance to decide whether or not to have a child .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has become so advanced , it might be possible in the future for gene-editing techniques to be perfected and widely used , allowing you to give your baby a brighter future .
This is the responsibility that comes with being a parent .
In my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place .
In conclusion , after undergoing genetic testing and learning that you carry a particular genetic risk , you have responsibilities to yourself , your relatives , and future generations , including telling your family the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider a case in which we decide to undergo genetic testing and know the result .
We found that we actually carry the genetic risk .
Then it becomes difficult to decide whether we need to tell our relatives who may also carry this genetic risk .
There really are a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on our whole lives .
As a result , what should we do ?
Should I tell them , or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives because we really care about their health .
For example , diabetes is a genetic disease .
Once we find out we carry this genetic risk , we should tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may begin to pay more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less sugary food and maintaining a positive mood .
It is important for those young people .
The earlier we teach them , the more likely they are to develop good habits that will benefit them for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing to see whether they are carriers , which is better for them .
However , some people may ask why we would want to interfere with their lives .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they learn that they or their descendants may have a severe , untreatable blood disease .
Imagine you are living a normal life , and then one day a relative comes and tells you that there is a chance you might develop a disease in the future . How would you feel ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there is a chance that the genetic test result is incorrect , which means they are wasting their lives worrying about it , so we are causing them unnecessary trouble .
Personally , I feel that we should still take responsibility and tell them about the situation .
Since this will greatly affect their lives , we should try to handle it in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should remember that , although we may influence their lives , we can still allow them to make the right choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to have another child because of this genetic problem , and they will begin looking for ways to prevent their baby from inheriting this genetic risk .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo genetic testing .
Maybe after we tell them they will go for it and learn more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should remember that they are our loved ones . We need to tell them and help them .
A genetic-risk carrier should be obliged to tell others .
Genetic testing will be conducted when an individual is at risk of developing a disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be disclosed to their relatives has caused widespread social controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of the carrier 's privacy and should be prevented .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , a carrier of a known genetic risk has an obligation to inform their relatives about their situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can alert the patient 's family members and make them aware of a disease they may also have .
As we all know , individuals who carry genetic risks are likely to pass them on to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky genetic variant , other family members may also be at risk for the disease .
Some diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is older .
Therefore , informing the relatives about the situation may prevent a lot of trouble and save time in providing proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved if they are detected early and treated promptly .
Out of consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can prevent genetic diseases from being passed on to the next generation when they intend to have children .
They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage .
They need to ask a doctor for advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genes are passed only to boys , while others are passed only to girls .
If a carrier refuses to tell the truth to their spouse , another person may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in a newspaper years ago .
A couple in China have a 5-year-old son .
Their son unfortunately fell ill , and he was diagnosed with a very serious genetic disease .
They were told that the wife 's family carried a polygenic disorder that could be passed only to boys , not to girls .
Therefore , their son inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had already known about the polygenic disorder before their marriage and did not tell her husband .
The son died after a year of treatment , and the couple later divorced .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and had asked the doctor for advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has a responsibility to inform their relatives .
On the one hand , it can inform members of the carrier 's family of possible diseases they may have and enable timely treatment when possible .
On the other hand , the disease may be passed to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to get genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people when they face disorders .
However , I thought that an individual 's genetic information is private and should be protected by law .
Therefore , I thought that a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their family .
The three reasons are as follows .
Firstly , information concerning genetics is personal and private , like people 's bank card details .
Other people should not be told , even if they are the person 's family or relatives , without the person 's permission .
The government should enact legislation to protect this kind of privacy .
People 's genetic information is shared with others .
They may naturally be aware of the person 's potential disabling disease or other problems .
They may develop a bias against this person or even abandon him or her .
People can not choose their genes , and they should not be judged harshly because of a bad gene .
So I think that , whatever the genetic information is or whether the genes match their parents , it should not be disclosed to anyone , not even their family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family , even breaking the relationship between the children and the adult .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However happy they had been before , a barrier would appear that would gradually destroy the family .
The relationship between parents and their children should not be measured solely in genetic terms ; it is something much deeper and closer .
Parents give knowledge and love to their children ; meanwhile , they are happy in their children 's company .
The children rely on the parent to live .
When they grow up , they take care of their elderly parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is one of love and dedication .
No one wants to see a family fall apart because someone is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think someone with a known genetic risk should not be required to inform their family or relatives without their permission .
Finally , the technology for gene testing is not very mature yet .
There is also a chance of incorrect testing .
If the doctor fails to identify a wrong test , the family and children may be sad and struggle for the rest of their lives .
Therefore , I think a person who knows they have a genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy , the possibility of erroneous testing , and the need to preserve family peace , I believe a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their family or relatives without their permission .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should inform their relatives .
With advances in medical technology , more and more illnesses are found to be related to certain genes .
People will know whether they carry a disease-causing gene after they have taken a genetic test .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to ensure they do not carry any disease-causing genes .
Therefore , once people discover that they carry disease genes , they should inform their relatives , at least their close family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from the same family and share a common ancestor , so of course they share some genes .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy about or afraid of .
If a person tells their relatives that they carry a disease gene , their relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also carry the gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease from being passed on to their offspring .
If relatives carry the gene for that disease , they can share their experiences with the person and offer help ; they can also teach the person how to communicate with others about the issue .
If they do not get married , they must tell their partner that they carry a disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
If he withholds information about the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby , which could result in the baby 's death or in the end of their marriage .
There was a story on TV that I watched .
A couple had not had a child for a long time after their marriage ; their parents were anxious and asked them to go to the hospital to find out what the problem was .
After he came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene , so they could not have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the conversation and decided to divorce her husband .
After obtaining the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it said that the woman , not the man , carried the disease gene .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears revealed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes they were born with .
However , they can prevent their children from inheriting the disease genes .
By telling their relatives that they may be at risk of carrying the disease gene , they can help their family members bond more closely and avoid many risks and conflicts .
Genetic testing has become a valuable way to predict the risk of a disorder and protect individuals who are at risk .
However , a family-related ethical dilemma arises as to whether it is right to inform a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that their relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Although genetic testing carries emotional and social risks due to the results , the consequences can be especially significant if other family members are unaware .
Then they are unable to find a suitable way to protect themselves or prepare emotionally .
Take Angelina Jolie , for example : she is famous , yet she revealed the results of her genetic testing regarding her risk of developing breast cancer .
Everything is n't that bad if you know how to look on the bright side and have hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier may experience tension within the family because the outcome is also somehow related to the risks faced by other family members .
However , I believe it is a normal reaction to this situation .
In addition , although in some cases the person and their family may face discrimination in employment and social life , they can suffer even more serious consequences , such as illness or death , if they can not overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but people can not blame it for being unfair .
It 's just that you have n't become strong enough to overcome hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a pleasant experience ; especially if the situations of other relatives worsen , you may feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever ; when it is revealed , it will be more shocking and upsetting .
As a result , it is in the interests of carriers and their relatives to be informed of the results of genetic testing .
Last but not least , although genetic testing is a personal matter , sharing the results with your family can foster mutual understanding and empathy and promote awareness of the need to care for everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in relatives ' ability to overcome societal discrimination and anxiety about risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe people have an obligation to tell their relatives about genetic testing results for the sake of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but it is necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparation and how you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family members and , if necessary , guide them should they wish to undergo similar genetic testing .
The Impact of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it .
I started using Facebook one year ago , when I first arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and am buried in hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each other 's statuses , updates , and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will no longer send SMS messages to each individual .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform them of these changes .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In some respects , social media has brought us considerable convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking on the phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like , and we have more personal space . Our friends also have more access to what we are doing and what we like .
We also get a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and learn more about their lives .
In China , many government organizations have public blogs to communicate with the public , such as fire departments and police stations .
Social media allows them to inform people about what is going on .
Actually , many rescue operations are carried out with the help of social media , such as searching for people who have gone missing .
With more convenient and humane communication , the relationship between the government and the people has greatly improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can learn more about the news and different cultures through social media .
From this perspective , social media has shortened the distance between us .
However , we have fewer opportunities and place less importance on talking face-to-face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
Even when we gather together , more people find themselves having fewer topics to talk about than before and choose to dig through their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it seem as if we are in front of each other ; sometimes , when we are by each other 's side , we seem to be farther than far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships less stable , secure , and reliable than before .
Besides , more people are showing pictures of yummy food or travel experiences .
To some extent , this makes our lives more luxurious and more prone to blunders .
Personally , I long to visit some places after seeing those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I ca n't even sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our lives move so fast and leaves us less time to think about them .
Social media is becoming increasingly important , and we need to think more about how to make it serve us better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skill , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media certainly has its benefits , but like all good things , it is best enjoyed in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information is readily available for their perusal .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
For example , one can send notifications and other information that we previously had in hard copy over the web , and the process takes only seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as almost real-time .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , much communication was done through means such as telegrams , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
With the advent of applications such as Skype and FaceTime , anyone can phase out most traditional communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a real interaction through expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without easily available social media .
However , it is good practice not to use social media intensively all the time .
Intimate interactions are greatly lacking on social media , particularly touch .
Meeting and interacting for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction that utilises the motor , cognitive , and verbal cortices of the brain to coordinate .
Unlike on social media , most interaction is done through thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relations .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Gardner studied multiple intelligences and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a distinct skill in its own right — some have it , others do not .
Howard Gardner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted and ranked using tests .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower in interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when these skills are needed .
Though social media is not necessarily bad , it must be used appropriately for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken into account : informing , interacting , discussing , and others .
The space between the parties must also be considered .
For people who live very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
Those who live in the community should at least meet up and not use social media as their primary means of communication with one another .
At the same time , it improves interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also foster better rapport among those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people form closer connections with one another by providing a more convenient and cheaper way to communicate online than face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will reduce people 's opportunities for face-to-face contact and thus negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chances of face-to-face contact among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base ; they help link people from different parts of the world .
Before social networks existed , people might not have had the chance to meet people from different countries or those they would otherwise never have met .
The number of people they know may be limited to those they meet in daily life , such as classmates and coworkers .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people , and they may have the chance to chat with people they had never known before , which helps develop their interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks allow people to chat online rather than face-to-face , they may still use them to schedule in-person meetings in daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people increase the frequency of their conversations .
For example , if social networks did not exist , businesspeople would need to meet face to face , which is time-consuming ; even for less important matters , travel still takes a lot of time and is wasteful .
However , social networks help people meet and chat much more easily ; they can even use video chat and create group chats to talk with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants because it saves time and money .
The social network may also create some negative impacts on people .
The greatest negative impact is that , because of the internet , some people begin to use and rely on it every minute .
They spend too much time using online social networks and therefore do not have time for their daily meetings with people in real life .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but is also bad for the health of those who spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public ; because the cyber environment is imperfect and unsafe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively , and sometimes others may use that information to deceive them .
In conclusion , an unsafe online environment and spending too much time on the Internet may be potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient environment for contact and improves the frequency of meetings with each other .
It also helps people develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than costs .
The world is becoming increasingly flat because of all kinds of social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media has many advantages because it lets us communicate with friends more cheaply and conveniently .
However , its disadvantages can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform for showing off and a stage for cybercrime .
Social networking sites provide us with many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking to them on the phone , we can learn their latest news by scanning a webpage .
It can help us learn more about each other .
It can bring people closer as well .
For example , if you find out through Facebook that one of your friends ' favourite singers is Justin Bieber , you can give them Justin Bieber 's new album or a concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends who live very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we may lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they have been doing recently , as we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social media are undeniable .
Research shows that people unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another person 's real thoughts and personality by reading what he or she posts on social media .
It will make them quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice " people on social networking websites , one may neglect those around them and communicate only with friends on Facebook .
It is common to see two people sitting next to each other who seldom talk to one another but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health , according to research .
Cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication , and people who depend on it too much will not get used to real-life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
Without close real-life relationships and only close online friends , one is more likely to feel lonely because human beings have a physiological need to feel bonded to others through the five senses .
Because of people 's desire to be better than others , social networking sites have become places to show off .
Some people post their expensive possessions or the overseas places of interest they have visited on social media and feel a sense of satisfaction doing so .
It is a mental health issue and may cause people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
Last but not least , having all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page makes it convenient for criminals to use that information to commit crimes .
Above all , social networking sites are like double-edged swords , and people can best benefit from them by avoiding their possible disadvantages , such as by putting less personal information on their Facebook pages .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are common in contemporary society , and people can communicate with each other—online or offline—on these platforms .
They can even make new friends over shared interests on these platforms , which can closely connect people across many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions , as people prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media can disseminate information faster than any other medium .
About 50 % of people have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with current technology , smartphones can access social media sites , making it easier for consumers to use them .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all disseminated information or news is reliable .
False information or hoaxes may be spreading on social media .
For example , in 2012 there were false rumors , spread through Twitter and Facebook , of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a suburb of Mexico City .
This caused panic among the people , who flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and resulted in the temporary closure of schools .
The spread of false information can pose a psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information rapidly .
Nevertheless , cyber police patrol these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading .
Despite stringent security measures meant to control nearly every social networking activity , unreliable sources will still spread false information on social media sites .
Social media can improve relationships and help people make new friends , provided there is mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
Many teenagers today claim that they can keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends , and it took a relatively long time to send them .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to find new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , for people to maintain their relationships and make new friends , mutual trust and understanding between both parties are required .
It might not be accurate to judge someone else 's feelings from social media , since people may hide their emotions online .
In addition , people are more likely to miscommunicate with each other because they can not sense the other person 's tone on social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflict between the two parties due to miscommunication .
But if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it would be ideal for people to improve their relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in contemporary society can help people improve relationships , make new friends , and disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of misinformation and miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if its negative aspects are carefully addressed .
All in all , social media are the products of rapid technological advancement , and more are to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long-distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
In today 's globalized and interconnected world , Twitter and Facebook are the mainstream platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch on any electronic device , one can easily interact and communicate with one 's friends without much hassle .
Thus , long-distance relationships or friendships can be maintained , and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has become much easier .
The sharing of personal photos , the posting of one 's personal feelings or experiences , and the ability to reply to these posts allowed people to engage and expand their interactions with ease .
Introverts , or those who are shy about communicating with their friends , can now do so in writing via social media platforms .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms . Meet-ups and appointments are no longer barriers to people contacting and communicating with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's convenience .
Society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are transformed into cyber interactions .
With frequent use of and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises online will be more advanced and better adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help society progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns about using social media platforms to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed can not be proven physically , as media limit such physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain of the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive on the Internet .
We may , in fact , be communicating with a cyber friend 's hoax Facebook account that we assume is real but is actually fake .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a certain personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact on social media restricts actual interaction that could be stimulated through it .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotions , they differ from the authentic emotions you observe in your friends through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty inherent in this communication due to a lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behaviour , since communication takes place through social media rather than in person .
This reduces people 's ability to interact with one another , which can adversely affect their behaviour .
The lack of exposure to real-life interactions with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there needs to be a balance between social media interaction and face-to-face interaction among its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phones to read the news , and anyone can be the first to witness what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artist or celebrity they love , and Facebook to see their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they can still use their phones to make normal calls and send messages to contact people .
Not only can the phone do these tasks for them , but so can personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices that can connect to the internet .
It is obvious that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made that social media actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only use electronic devices to access the Internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and their fingers to manipulate the device .
As a result , they will lose eye contact and the ability to use their hands to express their feelings to people nearby , which means they will have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication .
This can easily be seen in restaurants and cafes nowadays .
A family of four is having dinner in a restaurant without chatting because they are holding and looking at their display screens with one hand while the other hand holds a fork .
A group of friends are having high tea in a café but not chatting because they do n't know what to talk about ; instead , they 're just pressing their phone screens .
Nowadays , children do not know what neighbourhood games are or who lives beside them ; all they do is press icons on screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduce face-to-face human contact .
When people become accustomed to using social media to contact others , their interpersonal communication skills will eventually deteriorate and be lost .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers ; they do n't even have the courage to talk to them .
Also , they will not have enough experience communicating with people face-to-face and will not be trained in conversational skills .
As a result , social media helps them do their jobs , but it indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the Internet to contact others and read the news .
A father may be able to call his daughter , who is in another country , via social media software instead of making an international call , which costs a lot for a family with an average income .
He can even talk to her daughter face to face via a video call over the Internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and can easily update their friends about their recent activities .
A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all his friends about his activities .
If one of his friends , who is not aware of this , fails to contact him by telephone , he might be able to find out his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save us most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways but also harms them .
People should avoid misusing social media and use it properly .
With the aid of social media , people form bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives are happier .
We all live in a technology-driven society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship , and now we can travel by airplane .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message because we had to post a letter ; now we can use email ( short for electronic mail ) or our mobile phones to send messages to our friends .
From the example I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is growing .
This is because , with advances in technology such as air travel , some of our friends might go overseas to continue their studies , or you might be away from your family to pursue your studies or career .
Thus , Twitter and Facebook have become essential media for us .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media , we can stay in touch and keep up to date with our family and friends even when we 're apart .
Social media sites such as Facebook allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
These approaches help parents communicate with their children and learn what kinds of activities their children participate in while they are overseas .
Social media is beneficial , as it connects you with your loved ones even when you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy you feel when you 're with your family , but it could help reduce the sadness of being apart from them .
As I mentioned at the beginning , there are also disadvantages to social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among youngsters .
This is because checking Facebook has become a habit for everyone , as their friends post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This could then lead to stress , as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they are distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own life by making the right decisions .
Although there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites , striking a balance between social media and real life is most important .
Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is commonplace in our lives .
In an increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online without having to travel to meet for business purposes or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing social changes , with virtual worlds overtaking the real world and negatively impacting individuals ' daily lives , thereby becoming a major problem for societies as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
Because people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face others in person , they feel more comfortable and therefore prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have the option of turning their backs on real life and going online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact with people .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits of investing such an enormous amount of time and energy are not perceived as positive by users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people use social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sudden sparks of attention are extremely short-lived and easily disappear , so they do not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
According to research , users feel sadder after using Facebook because they unknowingly compare their lives with others .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay , such as the connections among people .
Indeed , I use Facebook only to keep in touch with my friends .
However , friendships in such virtual worlds are so superficial and not very relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge traffic on such social media sites , they use them as ponds to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this may raise privacy issues , as Facebook allows some profit-driven companies to access users ' information .
As this happens , users are increasingly prone to fraud .
Social media sites are currently at their peak ; however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life , they will not indulge in them as much as they do now .
Users will soon realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends , because if they really need someone , they will reach their friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but are we really becoming more connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were created to connect people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , even the older generation , have at least one social media account , such as Facebook .
Parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can " follow " them more closely in real time .
People post their random thoughts or daily activities on Twitter and frequently share different kinds of photos on Facebook to be connected with their so-called friends .
However , since we tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly less face-to-face contact , our interpersonal skills eventually suffer .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and in different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange contact numbers and Facebook accounts to keep in touch .
Rather than just keeping contact numbers that we may never call , social media platforms like Facebook are a great way for friends from different fields or even different parts of the world to stay connected .
Within a few clicks , we could check a friend 's profile and read their updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall , and our friends could read it on the newsfeed .
This allows friends who may not have the time to meet up to stay connected in some way .
Not only that , new friends can easily be made through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to connect us can be the reason we fall apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduction in face-to-face contact .
This subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills , which inhibit the growth of our real-life social circle .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us , " Today is someone 's birthday . "
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greeting cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we felt so good writing one and , of course , receiving one with a stamp on it .
Gone are the days when wishes were personal ; now we send them en masse , and recipients may find such online wishes less meaningful .
As time passes , we may have more " friends " on our list , but the meaning of " friend " needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
Users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful about their impact on our real lives .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , but social media sites are only tools to enhance them .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people use social media sites .
These sites play a role in connecting people around the world .
It consists of functions for connecting , sharing , interacting , and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages of social media that affect society .
Therefore , this article explains the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , because social media sites connect people , everyone can interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers , without constraints of time or place .
Through social media , we can chat with our friends who live in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we can chat with our friends without traveling to those countries .
It saves a lot of time and money and strengthens our relationship , even though we live in different parts of the world .
Besides that , the company can also use social media sites , such as Facebook Chat or Skype , to facilitate meetings with parties to the project from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved by avoiding tiring travel from one point to another .
With the significant cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors , which benefits the company and boosts its profits .
However , there are always two sides to every story .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces face-to-face connections between people .
Since ancient times , humans have interacted with one another face to face .
Without facial expressions , it is easier to misunderstand a speaker 's intention .
That is why facial expressions are one of the most important elements of social learning .
In addition , the prevailing view in society is that social media sites will affect writing skills .
According to the statistical report , the more time people spend on social media sites , the more their writing skills decline .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to spell a word that we should know .
Autocorrection software is so effective when using electronic devices that we do not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for a person who expresses their own feelings and opinions .
" Privacy " is a word that has become popular over the past few decades .
Humans have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree to these terms .
However , there is news that social media sites are leaking users ' information to companies in exchange for cash .
Everything we type on social media sites is recorded on servers and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising .
Although it may seem like there are no laws and that it 's your own space to say and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by the government 's laws but also spied on by the government .
In conclusion , every story has two sides .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To use the technology effectively , we should make an effort not only to balance its pros and cons but also to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks .
Thus , the new technology will bring a prosperous future for our generation and the next .
With the widespread use of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has become a major trend and part of daily life .
In this situation , both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
On the one hand , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought into our lives .
Social media allows people to contact each other anytime and anywhere .
Whether we are at home , at school , at work , or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to interact by continually writing comments .
When our phones stop working , we can also use social media to get in touch with our friends .
Some people who try to speak in public can also actively take part in group chats on social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends bring their friends along .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends ' statuses and contact friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to rethink the influences of social media .
There are still many disadvantages to using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are increasingly willing to use it to chat rather than engage in face-to-face conversations , which require a specific time and place .
People who are not good at chatting in public may be more reluctant to talk to others , and their interpersonal skills may never improve in such circumstances .
Secondly , people 's excessive use may needlessly exacerbate social alienation , causing some social media users to become overly dependent on virtual social networks .
More and more networking has been transferred from real life to the internet .
This is a potential danger for teenagers growing up amid social changes and could hurt them .
Thirdly , frequent upgrades to luxury living standards , along with other ostentatious displays , may make people 's daily lives increasingly pretentious , which is not a desirable social trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction , and their studies and work may be greatly affected .
Since we can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media and can not deny the huge benefits it has brought us , this prevailing trend is likely to continue for a long time .
Therefore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
In this sophisticated era , experts continue to produce inventions meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation boundaries are no longer a problem because communication and information technologies have been continuously improved .
The telephone may be perceived as a major innovation when it was first introduced by Graham Bell .
However , since the internet was introduced , the telephone has started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are offered to users .
Let us take Facebook and Twitter as examples , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's contact details and addresses may change from time to time . On Facebook , people can keep in touch with old friends just by using a name and photo , for example , as identifiers .
Facebook is a combination of messaging and chat services , personal profiles , media-sharing , and other entertainment add-ons .
Social games allow users to communicate with remote people and to update and express themselves simultaneously .
Twitter , which has a simpler interface than Facebook , is more beneficial as a medium for sharing information .
Twitter only allows users to post updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread information quickly , so that only highlighted messages are delivered .
Facebook now offers a comprehensive way to share : users can upload multiple photos and videos , publish long notes , and even share documents and data .
These advantages also come in handy , as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects that people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that the frequency of face-to-face meetings among people who are addicted to social media has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication every word that comes out of their mouth , even if not well arranged , is a reflection of their personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
A family is having dinner together at a restaurant , but everyone is busy on their own gadgets , posting pictures on Facebook , updating their status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
Social media serve to bind people despite geographical boundaries , but that does n't mean the people around you should be neglected .
This relates to the interpersonal skills mentioned earlier , which can deteriorate if we become accustomed to interacting with gadgets instead of with people .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that , by showing only selected parts of our lives , we present a false image to the public .
We tend to share only our happy moments on social media .
Because of this , other people begin to think that our lives are full of happiness and have no problems at all .
Other people , then , are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think poorly of themselves , which may lead to depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem that affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern , sophisticated technology does n't always provide advantages .
There are many disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to people to decide which side they want to take .
We should never forget to consider and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision we make .
Nowadays , advances in technology greatly improve the lives of many people .
In most countries , social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter have emerged .
Many people believe that social media sites improve communication between people , while others argue that they have several negative impacts on society .
One advantage of social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In past decades , when social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by phone or even by letter .
However , calling someone on the phone and writing a letter to them incur costs , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes a long time .
The emergence of those social media sites has led to the resolution of those problems .
People connecting through social media sites can communicate without spending any money , and messages take only one or a few seconds to reach their recipients .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves time and money and provides convenience to many people .
Moreover , it provides an alternative way for people to contact someone they have not seen for a very long time , such as friends from primary or secondary school .
When we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to contact them by phone or by mail .
If phone calls and letters are the only ways to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as alternative routes to connect us with our old friends .
Hence , social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything that comes with benefits also has disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also have some negative effects on people and society .
The advancement of social media sites has led people to rely on them so much that some prefer using them to contact each other rather than talking face-to-face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
The use of social media sites indirectly reduces face-to-face communication , which in turn causes many people to lose interpersonal skills .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for communicating with others and presenting our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in people 's inability to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually become less able to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites have both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As members of modern society , we should learn to distinguish between the positive and negative impacts of technological advancement , and to minimize its drawbacks while maximizing its benefits .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in touch with people and the latest news has increased tremendously .
Some well-known examples include social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook .
With more than a billion users worldwide , social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success in playing an important part in our lives .
However , some argue that life on social media leads to a reduction in face-to-face contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives and in society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All a user needs is an internet connection and an email account so they can create a Facebook or Twitter account and begin their journey into social media .
Secondly , it helps people keep in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around you in real life .
Social media helps lessen the barriers of geographical distance and bring people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up to date with the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all just a click away via the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups , pages , or sites to share our hobbies , interests , and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have a negative side that impacts people .
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive the more time we spend socialising and interacting virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter , and this affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from using office time for personal leisure instead of concentrating on their work .
Using texting language as an informal way of communicating on social media also has a negative long-term impact on us .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend interacting with one another face to face .
Hence , it lessens valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from computer screens or mobile phones .
In addition , false reports and fake IDs also occur on both social media sites , with people using fake identities to insult or harass others , as in the recent case of Heather Chua on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and create a strong negative impact on the victim 's real life , which may make the victim reluctant to interact with others .
In conclusion , everything has a two-sided effect , and it depends on how we exploit it .
With today 's booming technology , it is evident that people are becoming more tech-savvy and want to spend more time interacting with each other on social media sites ; however , this does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook , and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless , and indispensable in our lives , people may worry that the younger generation will have problems with face-to-face communication .
However , I believe that the benefits offered by these online chat rooms far outweigh their drawbacks .
Social media enables us to explore the world far , far away without paying for expensive airplane tickets or taking a week off .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work , or at home , we can easily make friends around the world with just a click and learn about their lives through conversations , reading their blogs , viewing their photos , and checking their status updates .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation makes it easier for strangers to talk to each other .
Since some information has already been revealed on the homepage , it is easier to find common topics to discuss .
Moreover , people usually like to share their real feelings boldly online , taking off their real-life masks .
A report by Boston University in 2012 indicated that 80 % of information posted online is true , while a person may lie three times out of ten in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we behave as we do in real life , even though we have no reason to do so in the online virtual world .
Although genuine sharing of information can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful , such as through the widespread use of vulgar language and harshly worded comments , we can minimize these repercussions through strict regulation of online content .
Another advantage of social media is that it aids the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the disadvantage of incomplete information in some remote rural areas , where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One example is the 2012 riots in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of seeking democracy spread quickly from Egyptians to people in Zambia through social media .
However , the government controls most of the media .
These social media platforms may be tools of their campaign and may be manipulating the public 's thoughts .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong used Facebook to share his campaign videos with the public .
Despite this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to traditional media .
Intensive use of social media reduces the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is common to see in a food court or restaurant a group of people sitting together around a table , each holding a cell phone .
They are too busy with far too many virtual friends , and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is educate the public about the importance of having friends by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages in our daily lives .
What we can do is cautiously manage the time we spend online and the words we use online .
With regulation by the government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to social media , people all over the world can communicate easily .
Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages , such as knowledge sharing and trade , are also possible through social media .
Nevertheless , despite these advantages , some disadvantages may arise , such as a reduction in face-to-face contact that affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , and fraud committed through social media .
Twitter , Facebook , and Skype are some social media sites that enable us to keep in touch with our friends and family who are in other cities or countries .
Through these sites we can talk to our relatives , learn about their activities , and find out who their friends are . At first glance , there is no doubt that these sites help us maintain better relationships despite the distance .
Information can also be shared faster through social media ; that is why many news publishers nowadays create their own social media accounts . For example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and updates its followers with headline news .
That shows how easily news and information can be shared through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without their needing to watch or listen to news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started doing business on these sites .
More and more advertisements appear on Facebook ; whether they 're from friends selling products or from professional brands , we can buy from and contact sellers through the platform , which is an advantage for us as buyers .
However , is it the same to keep in touch with someone virtually as it is to meet them in person ?
I do think there is a difference , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other person to judge us .
Other than that , a message from one party may sometimes not be delivered properly to the other because communication is written , so the tone of the message when sent may differ from its tone when received .
Many people are very brave about expressing their opinions online , but in real life they can be shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to poor interpersonal skills as well as problems of trust .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people we meet on social media , since we will never know whether they are even real .
Some people fake their identities on social media sites so they can get to know more people , and some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more common nowadays because some people do not realize that they may actually disclose information they would not be willing to share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and be disadvantaged by them as little as possible .
It is common to see almost everyone on public transport looking at their phones or wearing earphones in today 's society .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries share the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step toward a human revolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular because they allow people to connect with others , even in different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as the loss of face-to-face communication skills , which are important in the workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach each other easily , even after a long period without contact .
In this fast-paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people can upload their new discoveries and funny scenes and receive updates about their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas , and my busy study life keeps me from contacting my old friends .
I use a popular social media site to keep up with my friends ' current statuses .
I can easily find a common topic when I contact them .
Many Malaysians cross the sea to work in Singapore .
Many of them are busy with work and separated from their children .
One of the managers at my workplace is in the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , her mother was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore , my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also very useful tools for people to start new friendships or relationships .
People with similar preferences become closer .
It is easier for people to approach others after learning the information .
Students can exchange their study experiences even if they are in different countries .
People can share cultural items or pretty photos online , and others can share in the joy .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are one of the useful tools that help people get to know each other better .
However , social media is a double-edged sword ; it also has some negative effects on our daily lives .
One disadvantage that concerns many people is that they lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to present themselves , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public interactions even without social media , we can not deny that social media affects some people 's interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create while trying to avoid any negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool for bringing people closer in this globalised world .
The use of social media has greatly influenced the way we communicate with one another .
Online friends become real-life friends , and real-life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has profoundly changed the way we exchange information and our interpersonal relationships .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
Social media has reshaped the way we communicate .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas and stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening . "
When we use Facebook , we post pictures and statuses .
We are actively presenting façades of our lives to others .
We tend to post pictures of our best looks and statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades to others .
The images we choose to present are tentative .
The audience is not a specific person but everyone we might know or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling through pages and pages of pictures and statuses and see one that they might find funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves that they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing a friendship requires both a well-rounded understanding of one another and caring for each other .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction in which we can show our emotions to the other person .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking their Facebook page , where they carefully choose what to present .
One can not truly show one 's emotions to another by texting a few '= ) ' signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not conducive to forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
Since I have a social network account , I seldom read newspapers or visit news websites because I can easily read the news in my friends ' status updates .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some political newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes , and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and they post about it often , I can simply block them .
Information was circulated .
The most popular information is circulated the most , so I can seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and filtering information .
This saves me a lot of time when I read newspapers and watch TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I have become real-life friends with people from online forums who share my interests .
I 've also discovered that some of my friends have interests in common with me , so our conversations are mostly about life , studies , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or , so to speak , on each other , but rather on whatever is interesting — the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress anyone but to obtain the information in which we are both interested .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from more human-based friendships that require sharing and caring among friends to more information-based friendships that require mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; however , we are still not sure whether it is good or bad .
It is just different .
The advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People who live in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults have a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media enables people to connect with one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some people , sharing parts of their lives , such as videos and photos , on social media sites has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was observed : a group of friends met and sat around a table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with those who lived far away .
It can take a few days or weeks for them to receive the messages .
Nowadays , people only need to type in front of a computer in their own rooms .
People on the other side will need only a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer problems , which is especially convenient when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become increasingly addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with those close to them , they lose their face-to-face interpersonal skills .
Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting that can never be considered true communication .
When people chat on social media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotion conveyed , and even expressions are typed using combinations of punctuation marks .
For convenience , words are often shortened to just three or four letters , such as 'lol ' ( meaning laugh out loud ) and 'asap ' ( meaning as soon as possible ) .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Once they are communicating face-to-face with people , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a really big problem .
Social media also provides people with a huge amount of information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it 's exciting to follow people you adore , such as famous movie and TV stars , businesspeople , and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers ' lives and works .
People can easily obtain updated news they care about by refreshing their social media feeds on their smartphones and laptops at almost any time .
However , after you register on unreliable social media sites , all the information you provide can be used against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be of the person the user says he or she really is .
The reason might be that they just want to " decorate " their face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other end is deceiving you to obtain information about you and use it against you .
The absence of a pledge of authenticity puts people 's information and privacy on social media at risk .
To sum up , social media have advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily lives .
It shortens distances between people around the world and makes instant communication possible .
It is more convenient to obtain and update information using social media .
On the contrary , social media causes people to lose their ability to communicate effectively in real life and puts them at risk of exposing their private information to people whose identities can not be verified on social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
As technology develops , social media plays an increasingly significant role worldwide .
Everyone in the world ca n't stop using it ; every day they use it to express their feelings and ideas and to log other things that help their friends learn more about their lives .
However , it also raised concerns about whether it will bring us more benefits or lead to a human disaster .
Although it helps connect us with our friends wherever we are , it also reduces our opportunities to talk with them face-to-face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages is a difficult question for everyone .
Many people say they will support social media because it helps them get a closer view of how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only source they can turn to for learning everything that has happened in their home country and for sharing their lives with their lovers as well .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading information .
Nowadays , people can easily post their rental information on Facebook and wait for responses from people around the world , which is very convenient .
It is quite significant , especially for teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and find out what is happening in the world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also many people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the negative effects on teenagers who are still developing .
They pointed out that social media actually reduces the chance that we will talk to the people around us face-to-face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it 's quite common to see people at parties looking at their phones and reading posts on Facebook when they feel bored .
People worry that if teenagers continue to use social media frequently , their ability to talk to others will decrease .
They will find it difficult to come up with topics to talk about with other people .
Personally , I strongly believe that social media brings more disadvantages than advantages .
Although it can be useful for letting others know we really live a good life , it also wastes a lot of our time .
Think of it another way : if we spent the time we spend browsing those sites on something else , we might already have finished a book or done other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways to contact our family and friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use it wisely , no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that they need to be cautious about the time they spend on social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we use social media wisely rather than abuse it , we will all live better lives .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media
Nowadays , as technology becomes increasingly advanced , more and more social media platforms are becoming part of our daily lives .
You can see people using Facebook and Twitter on their smartphones or iPads on buses and trains .
Some may say that the emergence of these modern media will reduce people 's chances of communicating face-to-face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First , social media makes it easier for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago , when these modern products were not popular , people 's ways of communicating with people far away were still limited to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some will take a long time , and others are not efficient enough for people to get a response .
However , social media effectively addresses these problems .
People can contact their friends on the Internet and get a reply very quickly .
Communication is not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or by showing emotion .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations , see comments online , and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media platforms make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may cause some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the Internet rather than communicating face to face , which will negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real lives .
Actually , I 've found that some people are very funny and interesting when I chat with them online .
However , they are quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers develop their interpersonal and social skills as they grow up .
If they spend too much time on social media , it may cause problems for their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when communicating with people face-to-face .
Some may spend less and less time with their families and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , inaccurate information on websites will affect and confuse teenagers .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the rise of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through social media .
It can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So we need to make the best use of social media and use it as a fun way to add excitement when life is boring .
Try to bypass the shortcomings .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The emergence of social media sites has brought people closer together .
People can learn about their friends ' recent looks and interesting things that happen to them just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly prevent old friends from losing contact and the opportunity to communicate with you , even when you are in a different country .
However , social media sites reduce face-to-face communication , which adversely affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages to using social media in people 's daily lives .
Firstly , social media sites can help people connect more closely with their friends and parents .
By typing words and sharing pictures , people can express emotions they are too shy to show .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are too shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , so they type it on their mothers ' Facebook pages .
Then their mother will also understand the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the Internet is the only way he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people closely with their friends .
People can also find a lot of information about celebrities on Twitter and Facebook , such as Barack Obama and Bill Gates , and obtain first-hand study materials about them .
They can learn how these famous people succeeded , have the chance to talk to them , and learn what they think by using social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , homeless people or someone who needs money to pay for medical treatment can quickly get help from around the world , because once one person knows about their situation , they will share it with their friends , and many people will then learn about it and pass the information on to those who can provide assistance .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the people on social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they become accustomed to communicating by typing rather than talking .
People even prefer to talk to and meet their friends online , gradually rejecting face-to-face communication .
Social media truly limit interpersonal skills , so people lose the opportunity and ability to practice conversation and to connect with their friends .
Secondly , without true communication in real life , people lose the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood .
There are many people on social media who present a beautiful image and good content on their pages ; however , in real life they may be unemployed or live in poor conditions .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated into losing money , even their savings .
Therefore , social media is not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the advent of social media has greatly helped people in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages that will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Lives and in Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media have become more popular and even more important in our daily lives .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook , and microblogs , more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to leave their homes to interact with others ; they chat online , share pictures , and tell others what they have done or funny stories .
It seems that people build good relationships with others through social media , but problems can arise .
People do not know how to talk to others face to face , especially strangers .
Then we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and in society .
As for the advantages , there are two : it 's more convenient to contact others , and it 's easier to get to know them .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others via social media .
In the old days , if someone wanted to tell important news to someone who lived far away , they had to write letters , which wasted time .
The long distances and time required made spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact faraway friends and relatives unless there is something important .
However , people can now contact anyone in the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no delay in messages .
Another advantage is that it is easier to learn about others through social media .
Without social media , it is difficult for people to learn about strangers .
They may collect information about that person by asking their friends , colleagues , or family members .
The information collected may not be complete and accurate .
Today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online and know what that person did every day and at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily lives , they include wasting time , causing illnesses related to sitting for long periods in front of the computer , the rapid spread of rumors and fake news , and , most importantly , causing people to lose the ability to talk to others confidently face-to-face .
It 's weird that people sit around the table but are all facing their phones and do n't talk to each other .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page , they may say to others , " Hi , look how ridiculous this is , " and then laugh together .
Whether it 's a party , dinner , or just a simple get-together , there are always some people who bow their heads and play on their phones even when their family and friends are right in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages to using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media , be aware of its disadvantages , and try their best to prevent those disadvantages from affecting them , their friends , and their family .
Today , the world is considered to be in the age of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which connect people around the world in attractive ways .
However , some people worry that social networks can affect interpersonal skills , as they reduce face-to-face contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated below .
Nobody can deny the advantages of social media in connecting people regardless of nationality , race , culture , or language .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about how long it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to social media , you can contact your family and friends with just one click , wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos , and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , social media is cheap and easy to use .
Secondly , social media networks open the door to opportunities because of their great ability to connect people .
Many recent graduates can find jobs through Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can expand their social networks , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In the business world , social media is a good tool for developing and advertising products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages that have recently caused concern in society and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people spend most of their time on social media and have less face-to-face contact , which can affect their interpersonal skills and social relationships .
First and foremost , we should realize that the world of social media is neither trustworthy nor real .
Everyone can easily create the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media can create relationships , relationships and friendships become firm and real only when people have shared experiences and communicated face-to-face .
There is a story about a girl who has lived in the social-media world every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she formed close relationships with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them , and shared her life with them .
Eventually , she discovered that the eight people were actually the same person , as he had been using eight different identities to chat with her all along .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is a weakness .
Many people share their personal information on social media sites , which can lead to crime and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family , friends , and banks and to commit crimes such as blackmail and ATM theft .
Last but not least , social media affects people 's interpersonal skills when they spend more time on social sites and avoid opportunities to participate in everyday social activities and interact with others .
Recent research has shown that the more time people spend on social media sites , the less ambitious they become .
As a result , if the situation continues in this unexpected trend , it will have a negative effect on the younger generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has its pros and cons .
So do social media networks .
It is not only convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing businesses , but it can also damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is beneficial only when we use it correctly and combine online platforms with real-life interaction to develop people 's potential to the fullest .
