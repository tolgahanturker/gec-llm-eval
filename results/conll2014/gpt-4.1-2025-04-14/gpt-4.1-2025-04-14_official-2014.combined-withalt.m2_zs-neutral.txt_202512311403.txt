Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chances of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you will definitely develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you may develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing frightening effects in our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes can easily change , either by caring for us too much or by keeping away from us .
And neither is what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted by worrying about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us throughout our whole lives , because we will never know when the " potential bomb " will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the perspective of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is helpful for preventing potential family diseases , we can always look for more opportunities for the family to exercise .
And we keep track of all family members ' health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when other members get this disease .
Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there is currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members , who are therefore also at risk , is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a certain disease 's genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and be known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than secrets .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has become aware of a genetic disorder , disclosing it to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual 's moral system .
The issue of the right to know or not to know is highly debatable . Although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parent—his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts , or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Does one who suffers from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic health checks on their own .
Sometimes certain family structures and cultural beliefs can influence patterns of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from—the son or daughter , for example—the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being allowed to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , whether adult or at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information , as they may not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically ' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself , while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are social constructs , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to depend on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk in making considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal morals and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
People with a close blood relationship generally share some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry a genetic risk , it is better for the patient to inform his or her close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that family members are able to perform some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease , or they may go to the hospital and check for the corresponding flaws .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of personal privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to inform his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a great extent .
Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it a secret , as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying a certain disease .
Especially for young people who are not married , if he or she is known to have some genetic risk , there is a certain chance that their child would carry the same disease , but it is not certain .
Therefore , keeping the information secret from his/her future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk could cause family members to be scared of this particular issue . Although the factor may not be that serious , people might still fear that they could develop a potential disease in the future , leading them to go to the hospital for additional checkups or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , which creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect relationships with relatives , as sometimes others may choose not to stay too close to the carrier in order to reduce their chances of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help maintain privacy , it has much larger negative impacts on family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse that they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the fact before the baby is born and a certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease is closely related to the genes people are born with , as well as their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he or she is at risk of developing diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat fewer candies and chocolates to prevent taking in too much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tells this information to their relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes , and they can take the same measures to consume less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we can say that the benefits of telling carriers ' relatives about their genetic risk outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to inform their relatives , in order to let them know and help prevent the potential disease through daily exercise .
Among all kinds of diseases , a large number of different disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorders may or may not be inherited hereditary diseases , and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases .
It has long been discussed whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by a gene .
From a legal perspective , the answer is no , but from an ethical perspective , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to force a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about their genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , what kinds of diseases someone has belongs to his or her privacy .
Privacy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to disclose his or her privacy to others , especially when the person is not willing to do so .
It is against his or her human rights , and it is against the spirit of the law .
The law 's spirit also includes fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law that only points to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to enact such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to enforce .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and siblings , or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you say you only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of the law .
Other relatives may have the same possibility of having this kind of disease .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from an ethical point of view .
To the carrier himself or herself , he or she should have a feeling of responsibility to tell his or her relatives about their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save the lives of some of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with a bad gene may not necessarily have those genetic diseases if they maintain a corresponding healthy lifestyle before the age at which the gene 's function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetically caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems that make it harder for the carrier to digest fat and salt in the blood , which can lead to hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may increase their chances of developing hypertension .
They can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't force genetic problem carriers to tell their relatives about their disease , but they should be willing to inform their relatives about their genetic problem .
By doing so , fewer of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , many medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for individuals to decide whether to undergo it .
It is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk were to be shared within the family or with relatives , there might be a chance that they have it in their blood , which would allow them to take necessary precautions to prevent it .
But if it is a terminal disease , such as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion that it should be kept a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal information that should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realizing their conditions .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform their relatives as he might end up disheartening his extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they do not bring any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate to keep the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it would be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of having the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or take measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases are involved , given the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is detected in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having a genetic risk , the relatives of those with this genetic disease will undergo a medical check-up , which might help them realize it at an earlier stage .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it to continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk of the disease will just add to their misery , as there is nothing they can do about it .
All in all , it depends on the individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examination is beneficial as it will dispel unwanted doubts and positively influence the psychological state of those affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given regarding informing his or her relatives .
They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision-making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision to inform the relative should be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such a genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of the parents or the patient themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put on the immediate family as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt , with regard to their family pride or reputation , upon learning that such a genetic disorder runs in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives , since it is a genetic disorder .
There is a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and other members within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such a genetic disease is vital , as it may help to raise awareness and prevent the genetic disorder .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial to their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and aided in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital , as they reassure the genetic risk carrier that he or she is not alone in facing this illness , and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment regarding the future prospects of the genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such a genetic disorder will depend on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in deciding whether to inform others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of whether it is mental or physical , is always easily noticed by his or her family .
When it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance occurs generation by generation , but not all offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies , as none of their members exhibit any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , if one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware of whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue : whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives .
If the disorder symptoms appear in a child , the parents will be informed by the medical staff , and then the whole family will stay alert to their health .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult who has the choice to decide whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , it will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself or herself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true , and of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of it the other way : if a child in the family knows that he is at risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and that the risk might also be inherited by his own child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , he or she will consider not having any children after getting married , and the same thought applies to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family line ends the moment the adult carrier announces his condition .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think of having more children and grandchildren to make the family livelier and stronger .
The reason behind this is that after WWII , the population of China decreased dramatically , so the government encouraged people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members exhibits genetic disorder symptoms , he will fall into an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential genetic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling their relatives about his or her genetic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
Regardless of whether the disorder is rarely fatal or does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell their relatives about it .
One of the reasons is that , as a carrier , he or she needs mental support to get through this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
By telling his or her family , in addition to providing support , they could possibly help her find alternative solutions to the problem she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the career .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it would be better for the carrier to inform his or her family , as other family members might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they can have a full check-up , and it would be even better if they could prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform others , especially if it is contagious , as the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading to society .
For every action , there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to family members , as they do not want to make their family worry , feel uncomfortable , or even feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to her family .
I could understand the feelings of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , I personally feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feelings , and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything happens to the carrier , not informing the family members could cause them great regret if she leaves without their knowledge .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions to her problem with the family members , as there are more minds to consider it , rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that support , whether mental or even monetary , from your family could help the carrier fight against the genetic disease .
It is true that there are many cancer patients who are given a second chance to live as normal people because they have strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease , as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As the technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology .
Genetic testing has made it possible to easily determine if someone is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness ; however , it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is in the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has the right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier ; however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with the unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live with the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that was 'normal ' to everyone in the past , as genetic testing was not possible .
It might be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of preventing the birth of disabled individuals and sparing them from suffering in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled child does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to be obligated to tell anyone but has the responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turned out to be something that the carrier could not accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts .
After realizing that he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to this fact and create more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face them with relatives , but he still has no obligation to tell .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic test and take appropriate action based on the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might experience and the sense of guilt can be greater than expected and could be a burden on the mind for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing about any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be disclosed to others , especially close family or relatives , is a topic worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as a family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , several arguments will be presented in support of the view that any carrier of a known genetic risk should inform his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , who welcomed us to this new world .
We were crying hard , but we were not alone ; it was our family and relatives who raised us .
Hence , they should be the people we are grateful for and the people with whom we would like to share joy .
However , in the case of any health issue or serious disorder , it may seem pointless to share , but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform their family and close relatives .
As the health issue is related to genetic risk , the keyword " genetic " highlights the risk of passing the disorder down to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that it is obligatory for a carrier of known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future .
Despite the argument that it is up to the individual to disclose such a health issue or to bear it alone , it is certainly helpful to share it with close relatives for a proper discussion of solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed when facing such a risk of disorder .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle against such disorder risk .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , it will involve more than just one family .
Therefore , I would agree with the obligation to inform the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and has plans for having children .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the position of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test is conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh its disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction , whether he or she should inform their relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for the disorder .
This is the common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" This issue has been discussed for a long time . "
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue , which is whether we should or should not .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence below : " I would be anxious about my family if he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk . "
Frequently , the intention of the carriers is not to tell their families because they want to continue their own lives without the anxiety of their families .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against the demon .
A demon is not easily defeated , and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support that you can not obtain by yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic factor is so serious that it can not be described .
The seriousness can be greater than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for the rest of one 's life , or even dying immediately—these are consequences we can not imagine .
Families are the dearest in our lives .
Without their concern and support , it would have been hard for us to stay until now .
They play an important role in our lives which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to inform the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the agreement of the carrier .
It is the ethic of hospital staff to keep the secrets of all patients .
We can not blame them for being liable to the undesired consequences .
However , the hospital can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about the actions that can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of circumstance will not happen again and again .
It is a method that benefits two parties , which is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to inform his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to define .
Thus , advice from the hospital plays an important role in this .
Carrier is responsible for balancing his or her own interests with the benefits of family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate approach , it will create great circumstances for the career and families in the future .
With the risk of having a genetic disorder , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
Given that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual who is diagnosed as a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being genetic risk carriers as well .
Or they can choose to remain silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In my view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , for the following reasons .
First of all , from the perspective of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy for carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or may want to keep it a secret and not let others know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may cause them to be discriminated against or sympathized with by others , which are not positive factors in their lives .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can consult a doctor about it .
If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
This follows their own willingness , as they have to accept the truth , which may make their future life miserable .
Many people may argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a greater opportunity because of early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological and social influences , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown ; life , partners , spouse , and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen , which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and is prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the standpoint of human rights , freedom to accept relatives , as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For a carrier of a genetic disorder , knowing that he or she is a carrier causes more dilemma than actually getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell their relatives .
There are four reasons why people should n't be shy about sharing their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions—physically , by taking actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited by offspring , and mentally , if the action fails to prevent it from being inherited .
Many syndromes , such as Down syndrome and Taylor syndrome , can be prevented if the mother undergoes proper medical care and does not consume harmful substances during pregnancy .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives about her condition .
The more people ( relatives ) know about her problem , the more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to provide a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there are still chances of the gene being inherited .
So , they also have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases are costly to treat and medicate .
Albinism is one example .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and need regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you have cancer , the cost of medication is very expensive .
To prevent a bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell disease .
Usually , people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene , and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood blockages .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives , then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy about it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for parents to give a mental boost to their children with genetic disorders .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock your conditions .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones .
If not their family , then who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared themselves mentally first by disclosing the information about the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technology has improved a lot compared to the last century .
Particularly in the medical field , there have been great improvements in many treatments for formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose individuals at risk for genetic disorders .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk of a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma arises .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell their relatives about this .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about it .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives ; that is , if one family member is at risk for a genetic disorder , other family members also have almost the same risk of having it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Every family member has the human right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their rights ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder , but he does not tell his sibling James about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what is likely to be going on for him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risks of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having a similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement in medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce its negative effects on themselves .
In addition , doctors usually quote the statement , " Prevention is better than cure " ; this gives us the idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder in a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent it from happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
It is their human right to know about this , and it may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from occurring .
Together with the advancement of technology over the past decades , medical advancements have increased exponentially , and further enhancements are still constantly being made . Empowered with advanced medical knowledge , doctors are able to diagnose and conduct genetic testing for patients to help them prevent diseases and take necessary steps to protect their lives . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , the question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives becomes a challenging issue for both patient and doctor . In my opinion , I feel a strong urge to support the obligation to inform patients ' relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next of kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk ; hence , the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary preventive actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and , unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease , the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child . By making your family members aware of the situation , it would lessen family stress and suffering from forcing you to settle down and have children . However , social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are major concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives . It challenges the principles of confidentiality and privacy . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members . Early disclosure to family members brings positive reactions and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie , who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent . I still recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision to reveal private information . As in the case of Alzheimer ’ s patients , it is up to the patient to choose whether to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to determine who , how , and to whom Alzheimer ’ s disease will be disclosed to minimize potential negative impact on family members ( DementiaToday , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer ’ s patients , such as the Alzheimer ’ s Association ( Alzheimer ’ s Association , 1980 ) . Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases that might not be receiving all the help and support from everyone , the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is the utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
In conclusion , the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors about the extent to which a doctor should reveal information to relatives about a genetic disease and in which situations it is open to the patient 's decision . In addition , the state could also encourage the creation of assistance schemes to provide necessary help to needy patients , encouraging them to open up for the benefit of themselves and their family members . Although it may face challenges from social and ethical issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of their loved ones .
Nowadays , research in the genetic field has advanced further and further due to rapid technological progress .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , was started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , an even more popular topic arises , as the technology is already very mature .
While most people agree that each individual has the right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different views on whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example : all the people in Singapore , including students at school , travelers at Changi Airport , workers in offices , as well as passengers on the street , are required by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a group of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to inform their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and as a favor to preserve the family foundation .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to gain their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death .
Family members , as one of the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of a genetic disorder .
A study by New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recover 2-4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arouse some unnecessary doubts and panic , which will endanger family harmony .
While every family needs to go through this or that kind of troublesome situation , the more troubles a family has gone through together , the greater the bond that will be established between the family members , as well as a greater amount of trust , love , and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in and loves each other , all these troubles are just tests to make them stronger .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson say , what does n't kill you makes you stronger .
Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the patient 's choice whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about the disease .
The courage to undergo genetic testing and to inform relatives about the risk they may have can result in people being judgmental , even though it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest that the person at least share the information with his or her potential partner ( husband or wife ) , since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about genetic diseases , and many of them will most likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases , since they feel that the patients are abnormal or " weird . "
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble Boy disease , autism , or Down syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it , whether or not they realize it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment as others , and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear , and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family , since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
Especially when it is just a risk , the choice is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell family members about the risk since some of them may be affected . While I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a concern .
Maybe we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal matter , it is up to the individual to decide whether to inform their relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least inform his or her future partner about the potential risk , since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be situations where both the husband and wife are carriers , and therefore they should not have any children , since their child may not be able to survive even after birth .
Or , in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters ; therefore , although no one is obliged to disclose their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to share it with their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives about his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right to it .
He may have different considerations besides judging people , or he may worry about making his family anxious for no reason when deciding whether he should tell his relatives . No matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it , and we have no right to say that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless , and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvements in technology , genetic risks can now be detected .
Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build a family with others , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy what normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to support their child if he or she is not able to support himself or herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden called medication fees .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that is not able to work and may suffer pain throughout their entire life .
The other reason that parents should know their baby is a carrier of a genetic risk is for the good of the nation .
There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at a hospital after they realized the baby has diseases that need a huge amount of money to treat .
For countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
Without an increasing number of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate on development in other areas , such as the military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living in today , many miscarriages are conducted in hospitals every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , I believe the parents have the right to know about the health of their child .
Many people may support the theory that everyone has the right to enjoy the world , especially those with religious beliefs .
However , the problem is , will people really enjoy their lives if they have to stay in the hospital every day , with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children ; thus , they will make the right decision after they have been informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent such tragedies from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control of his or her information , and it is his or her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their children could have some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about .
The most obvious reason given by those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the result can significantly reduce the cost of multiple testing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of getting this disease .
If a person has a disease C , it might be a result of gene A .
He runs a test and knows that he has the gene AA .
This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene Aa .
This means one of his parents has gene A , and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved through personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if he or she is at risk .
Most people care about their relatives . If there is no serious consequence to telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that may arise when they disclose their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that they might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his or her relatives , he or she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very serious disease .
After he takes the test and is obliged to tell his relatives , everyone knows that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers . They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who carries this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define " relatives . "
If a gene runs in the family and one of the family members tests positive , whom does he need to tell ?
If it is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships . If person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needs to run a test because his cousin has this disease .
However , wife D is not even at risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theater .
In less than a week , half of the town knows person A has a risky gene , and his family might be a genetically at-risk family .
Then nobody wants to marry A or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his or her information , especially when the party to whom he is obliged to disclose his information is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives .
Carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also a better development for future generations .
Since the technology of modern society has become so advanced , it is now possible for people to decide to take genetic tests in order to determine whether or not they carry genetic risks that could affect their next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk .
In my opinion , the responsibility of informing family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own wellness and the health of your relatives , and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
The awareness of your relatives and family about your genetic risk is good for your own well-being and the health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is a great possibility that your relatives , such as your parents or siblings , are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health or put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone genetic testing , it 's just chance and fate as to what will happen to both you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone testing and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to have regular checkups .
Therefore , telling the families and relatives to get prepared to fight the disease and even prevent getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible to future generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to your next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on from generation to generation while being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you give them a chance to decide whether to have a child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has become so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of gene alteration is perfected and widely used , allowing you to give birth to babies with a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing in the first place .
In conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and are aware of carrying a specific genetic risk , you have responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and future generations by informing your relatives and family of the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider a case where we decide to undergo genetic testing and have learned the result .
We found that we are actually the genetic risk carrier .
Then it becomes troublesome to decide whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There really are a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we make may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives because we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a type of genetic disease .
Once we found out we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less food that contains sugar and maintaining a good mood .
And it is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , the better habits they will develop , and it will be better for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue why we want to interfere with their lives .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to learn that they or their descendants may have a severe , untreatable disease like a blood disorder .
Imagine you are living like a normal person , but suddenly one day your relative comes and tells you that there is a possibility you may encounter a disease in the future . What kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives , and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there is also a chance that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this , so we are actually bringing trouble to them .
Personally , I feel that we should still take responsibility and tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is try to make it positive .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we should still let them make their own choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem , and they will start finding ways to try to prevent their baby from carrying this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether or not to undergo the genetic test .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and learn more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should remember that they are our loved ones ; we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk for a possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be disclosed to his or her relatives has caused extensive social controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be prevented .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their actual situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can serve as an alert for the patient 's family members and make them aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genes to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky gene , other members in his or her family may also be at risk of the disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , informing the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save valuable time for proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved if they are told early and receive timely treatment .
For the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can prevent genetic diseases from being passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage .
They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genetic genes will pass only to boys rather than girls ; some are the opposite .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago .
A couple in China has a 5-year-old son .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease , which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenic disorder and that it can be passed only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore , their son inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had actually already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage , and she did not tell her husband .
The son died after one year of treatment , and the couple got divorced later .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and had asked for the doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can inform members of the carrier 's family about possible diseases they may have and enable timely treatment if possible .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier conceals the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face disorders .
However , I thought that genetic information is a person 's personal privacy , which should be protected by law .
Therefore , I thought a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons , as follows .
Firstly , information concerning genetics is personal and private , much like a person 's bank card key .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even if they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should enact laws to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's genetic information is revealed to others .
They may naturally know about the person 's potential disabilities , diseases , or other negative conditions .
They may be biased against this person or even abandon him or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes ; they should not be thought of badly because of bad genes .
So I think whatever the genetics are or whether the gene matches with their parents , it should not be told to anyone , not even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family , even breaking the relationship between children and adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However happy they were before , some barrier would appear that would gradually destroy the family .
The relationship between parents and their children should not be tested only in a genetic way ; it is something much deeper and stronger .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , while they feel happy with the company of the children .
The children rely on the parent to live .
When they grow up , they take care of their elderly parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is about love and dedication .
Not everyone wants to see the scene of a broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology for gene testing is not very mature yet .
There also exists some probability of incorrect testing .
If the incorrect test was not identified by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and struggle throughout their entire lives .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not obligate someone to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the possibility of incorrect testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a known genetic risk should not be required to be disclosed to family or relatives without the person 's permission .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to certain genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have taken the genetic test .
If there are no problems , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky as to be able to make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once people find they carry the disease genes , they should be responsible for telling their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and have the same forefather , so of course they share some of the same genes .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy about or afraid of .
If the person tells their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also have a disease gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease from being passed to their offspring .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share their experiences with him or her and offer some help ; they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she does not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries the disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of doctors .
Or else , if he withholds the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby , which could result in the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
There is a story I saw on TV .
A couple did not have a child for a long time after their marriage , so their parents became anxious and asked them to go to the hospital to find out what the problem was .
After coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene , so they could not have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce her husband .
After getting the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it stated that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears meant nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes with which they are born .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inherited by their children .
Telling their relatives that they may be at risk of carrying the disease gene can help family members bond more closely , and many risks and conflicts can also be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect individuals at risk for a disorder .
However , a family-related ethical dilemma arises as to whether it is right to inform a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our families , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequences will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves or make emotional preparations .
Taking Angelina Jolie for example , she is famous , but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing and the development of her breast cancer risk .
Not everything is that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can experience tension within the family because the result is also related to the risk for others .
However , I believe it is just a normal reaction to this situation .
In addition , although it is possible in some cases that he or she and their family may experience specific discrimination in employment and social life , how can people face more dramatic tragedies such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation ?
Life is hard , but people can not blame it on being unfair .
It is just because you have not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good feeling , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse ; you may feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever , and when it is revealed , it will be even more shocking and upsetting .
As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives that the genetic testing result be disclosed .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , sharing the results with your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy among each other , as well as promote awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in enabling relatives to overcome societal discrimination and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives , and , if necessary , guide them if they wish to undergo similar genetic testing .
The Impact of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vitally important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it .
I started getting involved with Facebook one year ago , when I had just arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each other 's status , changes , and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will no longer send SMS to each individual .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform them of this kind of change .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us a great deal of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like and we have more personal space . Our friends also have more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
Also , we get a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and get to know their lives better .
In China , many government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , such as firefighters , police stations , and so on .
Social media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
And actually , lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media , like looking for people who get lost and so on .
With more convenient and humane communications , the relationship between the government and the people is greatly improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can learn more news and cultures through social media .
From this scope , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we get fewer chances and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
And even when we gather together , more people find themselves with fewer topics to talk about than before and choose to dig into their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it as if we are in front of each other ; sometimes , when we are by each other 's side , we seem to be further apart than when we are far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships less stable , secure , and reliable than before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travel experiences .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious and blundering .
For myself , I long to visit some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our life pattern so fast and leaves us less time to think about our lives .
Social media is becoming more important , and we need to think more about how to make it serve us better and better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint , but like all good things , it is better to have it in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
This improves the connectivity among the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information that we used to have in hard copy previously over the web , and the process takes seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as almost in real time .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , most communication was done through methods such as telegrams , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
With the advent of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase out most of the old-fashioned communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a " real " interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice not to intensively use social media all the time .
Intimate interaction is greatly lacking in social media interactions , particularly touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike with the use of social media , most of the interaction is done through thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relations .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Gardner studied the effect of multiple intelligences among people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skill on its own—some have it , some do not .
Howard Gardner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilizing tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower in interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
Though social media is not necessarily bad , it must be used appropriately—for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of—informing , interacting , discussing , and others .
The space of separation between the parties must also be considered .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
For those who live within the community , they should at least meet up and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
And at the same time , it improves interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and physical touch could also foster better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people have closer connections with each other ; it is a more convenient and cheaper way to stay in contact online compared to face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face-to-face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face-to-face contacts among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base , which helps to connect people from different parts of the world .
In the days before social networks , people might not have had the chance to know others from different countries or those they had never met before .
Their number of people that they know may be limited to the people they meet in daily life , like classmates and work partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people , and they may have a chance to chat with people they have never known before , which helps to develop interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time for people to chat online rather than face to face , they may still arrange a time online to meet others in person in daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people increase the frequency of their conversations .
For example , if social networks did not exist , business people would need to meet each other face to face , which is time-consuming . Even for business that is not so important , it still takes a lot of time to travel , which is a waste .
However , social networks help people meet and chat much more easily ; they can even use video chat and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
The social network may also create some negative impacts for people .
The largest negative impact is that , due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They spend too much time using online social networks and thus do not have time to meet with people in real life .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but is also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect or safe ; people may not protect their privacy online effectively , and sometimes , some people may use others ' personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment and spending too much time on the internet may be potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient environment for contact and improves the frequency of meeting with each other .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than costs .
The world is increasingly becoming flat due to all kinds of social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages by letting us communicate with friends more cheaply and conveniently .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cybercrime .
Social network sites provide us with many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with them on the phone , we can learn his or her latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us learn more about each other .
It can also bring people closer together .
For example , if you find out that one of your friend 's favourite singers is Justin Bieber through Facebook , you can give him or her Justin Bieber 's new album or a concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we may lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they have been doing recently , as we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social networking media are quite undeniable .
A study shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she posts on social media .
It will make him or her quite upset when he or she communicates in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social networking website , one may neglect the people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk to each other but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health according to research .
Cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication , and people who depend on cyber communication too much will not get used to real-life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel a bond with others through our five senses .
With people 's willingness to become the best among others , social networking sites have now become a place to show off .
Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been to on social networks and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is a mental health issue and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
Last but not least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , a social networking site is like a double-edged sword , and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding its possible disadvantages , such as putting less personal information on their Facebook page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common in contemporary society , and people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends with similar interests on these platforms , which are able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people , as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
About 50 % of people have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than on reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to access social media sites , which has made it easier for consumers to use them .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb that had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among the people , who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted in the temporary closure of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading .
But there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media is able to improve relationships and help make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends , and it would take a relatively long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , mutual trust and understanding between both parties are required .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings on social media , as they may cover up their emotions while using it .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other , as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between the two parties over miscommunication .
But if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if its negative aspects can be carefully addressed .
All in all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement , and there is more to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long-distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any media/electronic device , one can easily interact and communicate with their friends without much hassle .
Thus , long-distance relationships or friendships can be maintained , and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of statuses about one 's personal feelings or experiences , and the ability to reply to these posts , human interaction is able to be engaged and expanded with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy about communicating with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms . Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interaction is transformed into cyber interaction .
With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socializes through cyberspace will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed can not be proven physically , as media limits this physical interaction—except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain for sure of the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
We may , in actual fact , be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but , in reality , is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a certain personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction , which could be stimulated through the media .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real , authentic emotions of your friends when you observe them through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of such media socialization is the uncertainty of such communication due to the lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behavior since communication is conducted through social media instead of meet-ups .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another , which can adversely shape one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real-life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction among its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phones to read the news , and everyone can be the first witness to what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artists or celebrities they love and Facebook to see their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they can still use the phone to make normal calls and send messages to contact others .
Not only did the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices that are able to connect to the internet .
It is obvious that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding the fact that social media actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose eye contact and the use of their hands to express their feelings to people nearby , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafés nowadays .
A family of four is having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because they are holding and looking at their display screens with one hand while the other hand is holding a fork .
A group of friends is having high tea in a café without chatting , because they do not know what to talk about and are just pressing on their display screens .
The children nowadays do not know what neighborhood games are or who is staying beside them ; all they know is pressing icons on screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact others , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and eventually be lost .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , and do n't even have the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people face-to-face and will not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do their jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and read news .
A father may be able to call his daughter , who is in another country , via social media software instead of making an international call , which costs a lot for an average family .
He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using a video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends on their recent activities easily .
A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activities .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save work most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways but at the same time harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
All of us are living in a technology-driven society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship , and now we can use airplanes to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we needed to post our letters , but now we can use e-mail , which stands for electronic mail , to send messages to our friends or even use our handphones to send messages .
From the example that I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is growing .
This is because , with the ease of technology such as airplanes , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies , or you might be away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become two of the media that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to those social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even when we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach helps parents communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas .
Social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones even though you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy you feel when you are with your family , but it could help reduce the sadness of being away from them .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page , as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This could then lead to stress , as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites ; however , in this case , striking a balance between social media and our lives is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is commonplace in our lives .
In an increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online without having to travel to meet up for business or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real world , resulting in some negative impacts on individuals ' daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in society as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face others in real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have the option to turn their backs on real life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-lived and disappear easily , thus do not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel sadder after using Facebook , and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments of their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay , such as the links among people .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends whose contacts I want to keep .
However , the friendship in such a virtual world is so superficial that it is not very relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they use them as a pond to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers privacy issues , as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to users ' information .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible fraud .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment ; however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life , they will not indulge in them as much as they do now .
The users will soon realize that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach their friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but are we really getting connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were created with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , even the older generation , have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and in real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities on Twitter and share different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to stay connected with their so-called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and in different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange our contact numbers as well as our Facebook accounts in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to stay connected .
Within a few clicks , we could check the friend 's profile and read their updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall , and our friends could read it on the newsfeed .
This allows friends who may not have the time to meet up to still stay connected in a way .
Not only that , but new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that pulls us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduction in face-to-face contact time .
This subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us , " Today is someone 's birthday . "
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greeting cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we felt so good writing one and , of course , receiving one with stamps on it .
Gone are the days when we sent personal wishes ; now we do mass sending , and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of their impacts on the actual life that we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , while social media sites are only tools to supplement them .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people use social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people from around the world .
It consists of the functions of connecting , sharing , interacting , and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to social media , which are a concern in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers , without any time or place constraints .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who live in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to their countries .
It saves a lot of money and time , as well as strengthens our relationship , even though we live in different places around the world .
Besides that , the company can also use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook Chat or Skype , to facilitate meetings with project parties from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved without the tiring travel from one point to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors , which benefits the company more and boosts the company 's profit .
However , there are always two sides to every story .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between humans .
Since ancient times , humans have interacted with others face to face .
Without facial expressions , it is easier to misunderstand the intentions of speakers .
That is why facial expressions are one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " is a common point of view in society .
Based on the statistical report , writing skills will be reduced the more time is spent on social media sites .
I believe most of us have had the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices that we do not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for a person who expresses their own feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' is the word that has become popular in the past few decades .
Humans have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Everything we type on social media sites is recorded on the server and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like there are no laws and it is your own space to say and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by government laws but also spied on by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides to the story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should not only strive to balance the pros and cons but also maximize the pros and minimize the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our generation and the next generation .
With the widespread use of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media such as Facebook and Twitter has become a main trend as well as a daily activity nowadays .
In this situation , both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to contact each other anytime and anywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by continuing to write comments .
When our phones are accidentally down , we can also use social media to get in contact with our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends along .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update friends ' statuses and contact friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to rethink the influences brought by social media .
There are still many disadvantages to using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are increasingly willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face conversations , which have time and place requirements .
People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to others , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved in this situation .
Secondly , people 's over-addiction may , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from over-dependence on virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing up with social changes and may get hurt .
Thirdly , frequent updates to luxury living standards and other ostentatious displays may make people 's daily lives increasingly grandiloquent , which does not reflect an accurate social development trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time on social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction , and their studies and work may be greatly affected .
Since we can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits it has brought us , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time .
Therefore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
In a sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies have been continuously enhanced .
The telephone may be perceived as one of the greatest innovations ever created since Graham Bell first introduced it .
However , since the internet became known , the telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to users .
Let us take an example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particulars and addresses may change from time to time , while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using names and photos , for example , as identifiers .
Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chatting services , personal profiles , media sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e . ) .
Social games , which allow users to communicate with remote people and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , provides more benefits if used as an information-sharing medium .
Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread the word quickly , so that only highlighted messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered , since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that the frequency of face-to-face meetings among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may not be well arranged is a reflection of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner together in a restaurant , but everybody is busy with their own gadgets , posting pictures on Facebook , updating statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serve the purpose of connecting people despite their geographical boundaries , but it does n't mean that those around us are neglected as a result .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that was mentioned before , which can decrease in quality if we are used to facing gadgets instead of human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a " false image " in public .
We tend to share only our happy moments on social media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all .
Other people are then influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think of themselves lowly and may develop depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem that affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always provide advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to people 's discretion and understanding to decide which side they want to take .
So , we should never forget to consider and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology greatly improves the lives of many people .
In most countries , there has been an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites have benefits for communication between people , while others argue that there are several negative impacts on society .
One of the advantages carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone or even a letter .
However , calling a person by phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
The emergence of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication , and it takes only one or a few seconds for the message to reach its recipient .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact someone they have not seen for a very long time , such as their friends from primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them by phone or letter .
If phone and letter are the only ways to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as alternative routes to make connections between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also have some negative impacts on people and society .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people rely on them so much that some prefer using those sites to contact each other rather than talking face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought about by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability of people to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites have both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between the positive and negative impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the drawbacks and maximize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in touch with people and the latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the most famous examples are social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing number of users—more than a billion from all over the world—social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success in playing an important part in our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media life leads to a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users need an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and bring people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all just a click away on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups , pages , or sites to share our hobbies , interests , and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have a negative side that impacts humans .
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time busy socializing and interacting virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also has a negative impact on us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face-to-face interaction with one another .
Hence , it lessens valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs on social media sites , where people use fake IDs to insult or harass others , such as the recent case of Heather Chua on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and create a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to an unwillingness to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided effect and it depends on how we exploit it .
With the current booming technology , it is agreeable that people are becoming more tech-savvy and want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites ; however , this does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook , and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless , and imperative in our lives , people may worry about the young generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chat rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far , far away without paying for expensive airplane tickets or taking a one-week holiday .
The convenience is indescribable .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work , or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a click and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos , and statuses .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation makes it easier for strangers to open up to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to boldly share their real feelings online , with their masks in reality being taken off .
This was indicated in a report by Boston University in 2012 : 80 % of information posted online is true , while a person may lie 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we are acting as who we are in reality , while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as the prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulation of online content .
Another advantage of social media is that it aids the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the disadvantage of incomplete information for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots that happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
However , the government controls most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and may manipulate the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr. Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
However , because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sit together around a table , each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their many virtual friends , and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is educate the public about the importance of having friends by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is cautiously manage our time spent online and the words we use online .
With the regulation of the government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trade can be achieved through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear , such as a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as some fraud that can be committed through social media .
Twitter , Facebook , and Skype are some social media sites that enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc . From the surface point of view , there is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well ; that is why nowadays many news publishers create their own social media accounts . For example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and updates its followers with headline news .
That shows how news and information can actually be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without them needing to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started to do their business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook . Whether it is our friends selling their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually as when we meet them in person ?
I do think there is a difference in it , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in sharing their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to poor interpersonal skills as well as problems with trust .
Nowadays , we can not really trust new people whom we meet on social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real ' .
Some people fake their identities on media sites so that they can meet more people , or some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more prominent nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share information they were not willing to share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and be disadvantaged as little as possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone on public transport is looking at their phone or wearing a pair of earphones in modern society today .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same situation .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human evolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular because they allow people to connect with others , even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as the loss of face-to-face communication skills , which are important in the workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast-paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes , and they can be updated with the new information of their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas , and my busy study life keeps me from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me know their current statuses .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy with work and separated from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore , my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also very useful tools for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or closer with the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach others after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their study experiences even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share their culture or pretty photos online , so others can share in the joy with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are a useful tool to help people get to know each other better .
However , social media is a double-edged sword ; it also brings some negative effects to our daily life .
One of the disadvantages that many people are concerned about is that people lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relations even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it does affect some people in their ability to develop interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , a shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to use and to bring people closer together in this globalised world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends became real-life friends , and real-life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has profoundly changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
Social media has reshaped the way we communicate .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas and stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening . "
When we use Facebook and post pictures and statuses .
We are actively " presenting " façades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with our best looks and statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are carefully considered .
The audience is not a specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages and pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think is funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves that they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendship requires a well-rounded understanding of one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction , where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his or her Facebook page , where he or she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions to another by texting some = ) signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forming relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore because I can easily read the news from my friends ' statuses .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some political newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes , and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and he or she posts them often , I can simply block him or her .
Information was circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I can seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and also filtering information .
This saves me a lot of time in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the two points of view above , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I have become real-life friends with people from online forums who share the same interests as me .
I also discover some of my friends ' interests , which I find I have in common with them , so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or on each other , but rather on whatever is interesting or on the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from more human-based friendships that require sharing and caring between friends to more information-based friendships that require mutual interests .
There are advantages and disadvantages in it ; however , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People living in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media enables people to connect with one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some of them , sharing parts of their lives , such as videos and photos , on social media sites has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered : a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media accounts .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with those who lived far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for them to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will need only a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer problems , which is convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with those who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting , which can never be considered a form of communication .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery , and even the expressions are typed in using combinations of punctuation marks .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to just three or four words , such as " lol " ( which means laugh out loud ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people face-to-face , expressing themselves appropriately really becomes a big problem .
Social media also provides people with a huge amount of information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people whom you adore , like famous movie and series stars , businessmen , and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers ' lives and works .
Updated news that people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops almost anytime .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites that are not reliable , all the information you have provided can be used as a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be of the person that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she wants to " decorate " his or her face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information and use it against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily lives .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And it has become more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and risks exposing their privacy to those whose identities can not be verified on social media sites .
How does social media help change our lives ?
With the development of technology , social media plays a more and more significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a lot of other things that help their friends understand their lives better .
However , it also raised concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages is a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them have a closer view of how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can use to learn everything that has happened in their home country and the way they can show their lives to their loved ones as well .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading information .
Nowadays , people can easily put their rental information on their Facebook accounts and wait for responses from others from different parts of the world , which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what is happening in the world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great number of people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the negative effect on teenagers who are still developing .
They pointed out that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at some parties that people prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry because if all teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will lose the ability to talk to people .
They will feel that it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate about with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages than advantages .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we are living a good life , it also wastes a lot of our time .
Think of it another way : if we spent the time we use wandering on those sites , we might have already finished a book or done other , more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use it wisely , no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live better lives .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily lives .
You can see people using Facebook and Twitter on their smartphones or iPads on buses or trains .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago , when these modern products were not popular , the ways for people to communicate or contact those far away were still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some will take a long time , and some are not efficient enough for people to get their responses .
However , social media solves these problems effectively .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their replies very fast .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations , see the comments online , and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , which will badly affect their interpersonal skills .
Some people spend a lot of time on it and forget their real life .
Actually , I have seen that some people are very funny and interesting when I chat with them online .
However , they behave quite boringly when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers develop their interpersonal and social skills as they grow up .
If they spend too much time on social media , it may cause some problems for their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face-to-face .
Some may spend less and less time with their family and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some incorrect values on websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the emergence of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media platforms .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantages .
So we need to make the best use of social media and make it a fun way to add some excitement when life is boring .
And try to overcome the shortcomings .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The emergence of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can find out about their friends ' recent appearances and interesting things happening to them just by checking Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly help old friends stay informed and maintain the chance to communicate with you , even if you are in a different country .
However , social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which significantly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily lives .
Firstly , social media sites can connect people more closely with their friends and parents .
By typing words and showing pictures , people can express emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , so they type it on their mother 's Facebook page .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warmth .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people more closely with their friends .
People can also learn a lot of information about celebrities on Twitter and Facebook , such as Obama and Bill Gates , and get first-hand study materials there .
They can learn how these people succeed , and they can also have the chance to talk with them and learn these famous people 's thoughts by using social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or those who need money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly because once one person knows the information , he or she will share it to their " friends area , " then many people will know it and spread the information to those who can help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population on social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online , gradually rejecting face-to-face communication .
Therefore , social media truly limits interpersonal skills , causing people to lose the chance and ability to practice talking and to connect with their friends .
Secondly , without true communication in real life , people lose the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood .
There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages ; however , in real life , they may not have jobs or may live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money , even their savings .
Therefore , social media is not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the emergence of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there exist some disadvantages which will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Life and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media has become more popular and even more important in our daily life .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook , and microblogs , more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their homes to interact with others ; they chat online , share pictures , and tell others what they have done or funny stories .
It seems that people build good relationships with others through social media , but problems arise .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially with strangers .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : it is more convenient to contact others and easier to learn about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In the old days , if someone wanted to tell some important news to another person who lived far away , they needed to write letters , which wasted time .
The long distance and time-consuming process made spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact their faraway friends and relatives unless there is something important .
However , people can now contact anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no delay in messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to learn about others through social media .
If there were no social media , it would be difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking their friends , colleagues , or family members .
And the information collected may not be accurate or true .
Unlike in the past , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online , and know what someone did every day at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , they include wasting time , causing illnesses related to sitting for long periods before the computer , the quick spread of rumors and fake news , and most importantly , making people lose the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk to each other .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page , they may talk to others in this way : " Hi , look how ridiculous this is , " and then they laugh together .
No matter if it is a party , dinner , or just a simple get-together , there are always some people who bow their heads and play on their phones even when their family and friends are in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages to using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of its disadvantages and try their best to prevent those disadvantages from affecting themselves , their friends , and their family .
Today , the world is considered to be in the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networks can affect interpersonal skills as they reduce face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages , such as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationality , race , culture , or language .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about how long it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever they are .
You can share photos , videos , and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , social media is cheap and easy to use .
Secondly , social media networks open the door to opportunities for people due to their great benefit in connecting .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can broaden their relationships , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In the business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages that have created worries in society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to spend most of their time in the world of social media and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the social media world is not trustworthy or real .
Everyone can easily create the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who has lived in the world of social media every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she formed a close relationship with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them , and shared her life with them .
Then , eventually , she discovered that eight people were actually one person , as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their real information on social media sites , which can lead to crime and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family , friends , and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft , and so on .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time spent on social sites and reject chances to be exposed to daily social activities as well as interacting with people .
Recent research has shown that the more time people spend on social media sites , the less ambitious they become .
As a result , if the situation keeps going on in this unexpected trend , it will have a bad effect on the young generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
So does the social media network .
It is not only convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing business , but it can also damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way , combining both social media sites and daily life interactions to develop people 's potential to the fullest .
