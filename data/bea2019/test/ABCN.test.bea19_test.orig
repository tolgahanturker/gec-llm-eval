Dear Sir ,
I have seen your advertisement for a job on the internet and I am writing to apply for a summer job as an instructor and keeper of children in your camp .
I am working as a teacher in Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
I am an easy going person with a lot of empathy for children .
On the other hand , in my leisure time , I usually do sports like jogging or swimming , adventures activities like trekking , climbing o espeleology too for 20 years ago .
